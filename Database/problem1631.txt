In this game, Shyam will ask Ram to perform tasks of two types:\n\nTruth task: Ram has to truthfully answer a question.\nDare task: Ram has to perform a given task.\n\nEach task is described by an integer. (If a truth task and a dare task are described by the same integer, they are still different tasks.) You are given four lists of tasks:\n\nTr,1,Tr,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Tr,trTr,1,Tr,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Tr,tr: the truth tasks Ram can perform.\nDr,1,Dr,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Dr,drDr,1,Dr,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Dr,dr: the dare tasks Ram can perform.\nTs,1,Ts,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ts,tsTs,1,Ts,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ts,ts: the truth tasks Shyam can ask Ram to perform.\nDs,1,Ds,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ds,ds: the dare tasks Shyam can ask Ram to perform.\n\nNote that the elements of these lists are not necessarily distinct, each task may be repeated any number of times in each list.\nShyam wins the game if he can find a task Ram cannot perform. Ram wins if he performs all tasks Shyam asks him to. Find the winner of the game.\nLet\'s take an example where Ram can perform truth tasks 3, 2 and 5 and dare tasks 2 and 100, and Shyam can give him truth tasks 2 and 3 and a dare task 100. We can see that whichever truth or dare tasks Shyam asks Ram to perform, Ram can easily perform them, so he wins. However, if Shyam can give him dare tasks 3 and 100, then Ram will not be able to perform dare task 3, so Shyam wins.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer tr.\nThe second line contains tr space-separated integers Tr,1,Tr,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Tr,tr.\nThe third line contains a single integer dr.\nThe fourth line contains dr space-separated integers Dr,1,Dr,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Dr,dr.\nThe fifth line contains a single integer ts.\nThe sixth line contains ts space-separated integers Ts,1,Ts,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ts,ts.\nThe seventh line contains a single integer ds.\nThe eighth line contains ds space-separated integers Ds,1,Ds,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ds,ds.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "yes" if Ram wins the game or "no" otherwise.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4tr,dr,ts,ds\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Tr,i\xe2\x89\xa4100 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Dr,i\xe2\x89\xa4100 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ts,i\xe2\x89\xa4100 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ds,i\xe2\x89\xa4100 for each valid i\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2\n1 2\n3\n1 3 2\n1\n2\n2\n3 2\n2\n1 2\n3\n1 3 2\n1\n2\n3\n3 2 4\n3\n3 2 5\n2\n2 100\n1\n2\n1\n100\n2\n1 2\n3\n1 3 2\n1\n2\n3\n3 2 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nyes\nno\nyes\nyes\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Ram\'s truth tasks are [1,2] and his dare tasks are [1,3,2].

Shyam\'s truth tasks are [2] and his dare tasks are [3,2,4]. If Shyam asks Ram to perform dare task 4, Ram will not be able to do it.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin2\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TRUEDARE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Data Structures, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1231\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-11-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
