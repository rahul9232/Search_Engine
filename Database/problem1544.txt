b'\nOne day Chef and Alice tried a new way to make their messages encrypted. When they had to write something, firstly Chef wrote the message vertically in a matrix of NN Columns.\nFor example when they had to write "helloalicehowareyou" Chef wrote it like\xe2\x80\xa6\n h a h e\n e l o y\n l i w o\n l c a u\n o e r a\n\nIf all the letters of the sentence were not sufficient to form a matrix they included extra letters at the end of the sentence to complete a matrix(here \'a\' is extra letter included to complete the matrix).\nThen Alice wrote the letters of each row in a single row in left to right manner to finally encrypt the message.\nThe encrypted message is "haheeloyliwolcauoera""haheeloyliwolcauoera".\nNow, your task is to decrypt the message encrypted by Chef and Alice.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of input contains an Integer TT denoting the number of Test Cases, Description of Test cases follows\nThe First line of each test case contains an Integer NN Denoting the Number of Columns used to encrypt the message.\nThe Second line of each test case contains a string SS as the encrypted message.\n\nNote:Note: The String contains lower case alphabets only. \nOutput:\nYou have to output a single line containing the Decrypted string.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4len(S)\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4len(S)\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSample Input:\n2\n4\nhaheeloyliwolcauoera\n5\ntyeoaoiroydsydxavgdy\n\nSample Output:\nhelloalicehowareyoua\ntodayisverygooddayxy\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n1\xe2\x98\x85rahul_ojha_07\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/AVH05\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, enma2019, rahul_ojha_07\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-03-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
