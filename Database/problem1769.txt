In the store, they offer N cans of coke (numbered 1 through N). For each valid i, the current temperature of the i-th can is Ci and its price is Pi.\nAfter buying a can of coke, Chef wants to immediately start walking home; when he arrives, he wants to immediately drink the whole can. It takes Chef M minutes to get home from the store. However, Chef does not know the value of M yet.\nThe ambient temperature outside is K. When a can of coke is outside, its temperature approaches the ambient temperature. Specifically, if its temperature is t at some point in time:\n\nif t>K+1, then one minute later, its temperature will be t\xe2\x88\x921\nif t<K\xe2\x88\x921, then one minute later, its temperature will be t+1\nif K\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4K+1, then one minute later, its temperature will be K\n\nWhen Chef drinks coke from a can, he wants its temperature to be between L and R (inclusive). For each i between 1 and Q inclusive, find the cheapest can for which this condition is satisfied when M=i or determine that there is no such can.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains five space-separated integers N, Q, K, L and R.\nN lines follow. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Ci and Pi.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing Q space-seperated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should be the answer for M=i: the price of the can Chef should buy, or \xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to buy a can such that Chef's condition is satisfied.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n|Ci|\xe2\x89\xa4105 for each valid i\n|K|\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\xe2\x88\x92105\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n\nN,Q\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n|Ci|\xe2\x89\xa4103 for each valid i\n|K|\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\xe2\x88\x92103\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4103\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 10,000\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 10,000\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 2 5 4 6\n1 6\n2 8\n8 10\n3 5 10 20 30\n21 20\n22 22\n23 23\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n-1 8\n20 22 23 -1 -1\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COKE2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Priority Queue, Multiset, Lazy Propagation, Sorting, Binary Search, Range Minimum Queries\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Queues, Sets, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Segment Trees, Algorithms, Searching, Queries\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2450\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-08-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
