b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThis is an interactive problem. Incase you are new to interactive problems, take a look at this link.\nAlice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a hidden integer xx; Bob only knows an integer NN such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4N and he has to find xx by asking questions. In each question, Bob must choose an integer yy (1\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa4N), and Alice answers 'G', 'L' or 'E' based on whether x>yx>y, x<yx<y or x=yx=y respectively.\nHowever, to make things more interesting, they decided that Alice can lie sometimes. In particular, she cannot lie two times in a row and when x=yx=y (i.e. Bob found xx), she has to answer 'E', so lying corresponds to answering 'G' when the correct answer is 'L' or vice versa. Alice can choose to lie at any time as long as she follows these rules.\nAs soon as Alice answers 'E' to some question, the game ends and Bob wins. Help Bob and win the game using no more than KK questions.\nNote: The grader is adaptive \xe2\x80\x95 the answer is not fixed at the start, but the answers to your questions are chosen in such a way that there is always at least one integer xx which is consistent with all answers (for some valid choice of answers that are lies).\nInteraction\n\nFirst, you should read a line containing a single integer NN.\nThen, you should ask questions. To ask a question, print a line containing a single integer yy. Then, you must read a line containing a single character: 'G', 'L' or 'E', denoting the answer to your question.\nAs soon as the answer to one of your questions is 'E', you must terminate your program.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (15 points): \n\nK=300K=300\nAlice follows a simpler strategy: she either answers the second, fourth, sixth, etc. question or the first, third, fifth, etc. question truthfully, but she may or may not lie in all other questions\n\nSubtask #2 (30 points):\n\nK=300K=300\nN\xe2\x89\xa4100,000N\xe2\x89\xa4100,000\n\nSubtask #3 (30 points): K=300K=300\nSubtask #4 (25 points): K=120K=120\nExample\nGrader              You\n5\n                    2\nL\n                    4\nG\n                    4\nG\n                    5\nE\n\nExplanation\nThe hidden number is x=5x=5. Alice decides to lie in the first question, so she has to tell the truth in the second question. In the third question, she decides to tell the truth, and in the final question, she answers 'E', since Bob asks about the correct value.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\narthurfn\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GUESSG\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2702\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-05-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
