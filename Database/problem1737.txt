He has NN segments [l1,r1],[l2,r2],\xe2\x80\xa6,[lN,rN][l1,r1],[l2,r2],\xe2\x80\xa6,[lN,rN] on the x-axis. A K-subset of these N segments consists of any K of these segments. For each K-subset, consider the common intersection of all the K segments, i.e. the set of points which belong to each of the K segments. The intersection of segments is also a segment; the length of a segment [l,r] is r\xe2\x88\x92l. Chef is asking you to find the maximum of lengths of the common intersections in all K-subsets.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.\nN lines follow. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers li and ri.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum length of a common intersection.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa4109\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 104\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\nExample Input\n1\n3 2\n1 6\n2 4\n3 6\n\nExample Output\n3\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: A 2-subset is a pair of segments. The common intersections of all pairs are:\n\nfor the first and second segment, the intersection is the segment [2,4] with length 2\nfor the second and third segment, the intersection is the segment [3,4] with length 1\nfor the first and third segment, the intersection is the segment [3,6] with length 3\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFKO\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Heaps, Sorting, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-10-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
