However, he knows that he can only become a successful coder if he works hard. Fortunately, he has a problem in mind for training.\nYou are given two positive integers aa and bb. You may apply the following magical operation any number of times (including zero):\n\nchoose an arbitrary positive integer dd\nperform exactly one of the following actions:\nadd d to a, add d\xe2\x88\x921 to b\nadd d\xe2\x88\x921 to a, add d to b\n\nChef is asking you to find out if it is possible to obtain a=b. Help him!\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers a and b. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to obtain a=b or "NO" if it is impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\nSubtaks #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5 7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: One possible strategy for Chef is:\n\nchoose d=10, add d\xe2\x88\x921=9 to a and d=10 to b; after this operation, a=14 and b=17\nchoose d=10, add d=10 to a and d\xe2\x88\x921=9 to b; afterwards, a=24 and b=26\nchoose d=9, add d=9 to a and d\xe2\x88\x921=8 to b; afterwards, a=33 and b=34\nchoose d=9, add d to a and d\xe2\x88\x921 to b; finally, we have a=b=42\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHFTIRED\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1130\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-10-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
