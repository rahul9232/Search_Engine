b"\nTweedledee and Tweedledum are in a fierce battle playing a complicated graph game.\nThe game is played on an undirected bidirectional simple graph of NN vertices (enumerated 11 trhough N) and (N\xe2\x8b\x85(N\xe2\x88\x921))/2 edges. We'll denote the beauty of vertex u by Bu.\nThe game goes as follows:\n\nFirst Twedledee places a token in one of the vertices of the graph.\nThen players alternate turns, Tweedledum goes first. \nIn their turn a player must move the token to another vertex following one of its adjacent edges, the turn is finished by removing that edge.\nAfter moving the token from one vertex to another, let's say from u to v, the beauty of the game increases by Bu\xe2\x8b\x85Bv. When the game starts the beauty is equal to zero.\nThe player that cannot move loses.\n\nTweedledee and Tweedledum are legendary grand masters of combinatorial games, so they always play optimally. \nPlaying optimally means that:\n\nIf there is at least one move that allows the players winn, then he will choose one of those moves according to the following priorities in order\nMinimise the number of turns, he want to winn as quick as possible!\nMaximise the beauty of the game.\nIf the player can't winn, then he will choose a move according to the following priorities in order\nMaximise the number of turns, he want to last the longest possible!.\nMaximise the beauty of the game.\n\nAda doesn't want to wait till the end of the game. Help her finding the final beauty of the game.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case consist of a single containing one integer N, followed by N space separated integers B1,B2,...,BN.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case print the final beauty fo the game.\nConstraints\n\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa4103\nThe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSample Input:\n1\n5 1 2 3 4 5\n\nSample Output:\n74    \n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85alei\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TWEGRA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Policy Based Data Structures, Convex Hull, Game Theory\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Algorithms, Computational Geometry, Polygons, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-10-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
