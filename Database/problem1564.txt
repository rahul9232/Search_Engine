b'\nIchika is the daughter of Kaneki and Touka. One day Kaneki and Touka\nwent for a party and left Ichika at home. Ichika got tired and wanted to do\na trick with her toys. She has NN toys and the weight of the iith toy is ii. Also\nbeing half ghoul she also has a superpower , which is she can make N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921\nclones of that type of toy. So at last she has N2N2 toys.\nNow, she has infinite bags\nin a line. And she starts putting her 1st1st toy in the 1st1st  bag,then the clone\nof first toy in the 2nd2nd bag,such that all the clones lie in consecutive\nbags ,no bag has same toy and the iith toy is filled from iith bag (she starts\nfilling first toy from first bag,second toy from second bag and so on).\nBeing her caretaker you have to pick up all the bags. For that you need the\nweight of each bag also the number of bags should be minimum. Your task\nis to print the weight of all bags starting from 1st1st bag.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer NN. \n\nOutput:\nPrint TT lines, each line should output weight of iith bag separated by space.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41062\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nSample Input:\n2\n1\n2\n\nSample Output:\n1\n1 3 2\n\nEXPLANATION:\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85kaneki99\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/IATOYS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, c-plus-plus, cnst2020, easy, implementation, kaneki99\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-10-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
