b'\nChef Ada is the FootBall coach of the Dinosaurs Institute of Technology.\nThere are NN dinosaurs (enumerated 11 through NN) placed in a line. The i-th dinosaur has a height of i meters.\nAda is training The dinosaurs in the following tactic:\n\nInitially the leftmost dinosaur has the ball.\nThe dinosaur that has the ball passes the ball to the nearest dinosaur to the right that is tallest than him.\nThe previous step continues until the ball reaches the tallest dinosaur, then he throws the ball and scores a goal!\n\nHelp Ada reordering the dinosaurs in such a way that the ball is passed from dinosaur to dinosaur exactly K times.\nFor example, if there are 5 dinosaurs ordered as [2,3,1,5,4], then the ball goes 2\xe2\x86\x923\xe2\x86\x925\xe2\x86\x92goal, and the ball was passed two times.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain T, number of testcases.\nEach test case consist of a line with two space separated integers N,K.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line conaining N integers representing one possible ordering in which the dinosaurs can be placed.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa428\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa420\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x921\n\nSample Input:\n1\n5 2\n\nSample Output:\n2 3 1 5 4\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85alei\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MXCH\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sorting, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-10-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
