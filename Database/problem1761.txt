b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nChef calls a sequence of integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN good if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\nAi\xe2\x8a\x95Ai+1>0Ai\xe2\x8a\x95Ai+1>0 for all valid i\nAi\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x8a\x95Ai\xe2\x8a\x95Ai+1=Ai for all valid i\n\nIn particular, any sequence with length 1 is good and any sequence of length 2 which satisfies the first condition is good.\nHere, \xe2\x8a\x95 denotes the bitwise XOR operation.\nChef gives you a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. You may perform the following operation on the sequence any number of times (possibly 0): choose 3 pairwise distinct valid indices a, b and c and change Ac to Aa\xe2\x8a\x95Ab. Note that this means the operation can only be performed if N\xe2\x89\xa53.\nChef is asking you to make the sequence good using at most 3\xe2\x8b\x85N operations or report that it is impossible. Note that you do not have to minimise the number of performed operations.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf it is impossible to change the given sequence into a good sequence using at most 3\xe2\x8b\x85N operations, print a single line containing the integer \xe2\x88\x921.\nOtherwise, first, print a line containing a single integer M (0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85N) \xe2\x80\x95 the number of operations you want to perform.\nThen, print M lines describing these operations in the order in which you want to perform them. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4M), the i-th of these lines should contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (pairwise distinct; 1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi,ci\xe2\x89\xa4N) \xe2\x80\x95 the indices on which the i-th operation is performed.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may find any one of them.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4104\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai<230 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85104\n\nExample Input\n4\n1\n69\n3\n1 2 3\n3\n1 3 1\n2\n10 10\n\nExample Output\n0\n-1\n4\n1 3 2\n2 1 3\n3 2 1\n1 3 2\n-1\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The sequence is already good, so performing 0 operations is a valid solution.\nExample case 2: The sequence cannot be made good using at most 3\xe2\x8b\x85N operations.\nExample case 3: We can make the sequence good by performing the 4 operations shown on the output, in this order. Note that the initial sequence is also good, so performing 0 operations is also a valid solution. \nExample case 4: The sequence does not satisfy the first condition and since N=2, we cannot perform any operations on it.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85akshitm16\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85taran_1407\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TOOXOR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bit Manipulation, Constructive\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2666\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-05-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
