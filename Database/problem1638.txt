People have started to spread the word and tell other people about the contest.\nThere are NN people numbered 11 through NN. Initially, only person 1 knows about Snackdown. On each day, everyone who already knows about Snackdown tells other people about it. For each valid i, person i can tell up to Ai people per day. People spread the information among the people who don't know about Snackdown in the ascending order of their indices; you may assume that no two people try to tell someone about Snackdown at the same moment. Each person is only allowed to start telling other people about Snackdown since the day after he/she gets to know about it (person 1 can start telling other people already on day 1). How many days does it take for all people to know about Snackdown?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of days.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nthe sum of N for all test cases does not exceed 106\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A1\n\nExample Input\n2\n7\n2 1 1 5 5 5 5\n5\n5 1 3 2 1\n\nExample Output\n2\n1\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: On day 1, person 1 tells people 2 and 3 about Snackdown. On day 2, the first three people know about Snackdown, so they can tell 2+1+1=4 people about it in a single day. That means the last four people get to know about Snackdown on day 2, so the total number of days is 2.\nExample case 2: On each day, person 1 can tell up to 5 people about Snackdown, so on the first day, he simply tells all people about it and the total number of days is 1.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SPREAD2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-10-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
