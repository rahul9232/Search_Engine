b"\nChuru got an assignment in his class, to compute the count of elements (floating point decimals) greater than K, if the list of non repeating elements was sorted. Churu has solved the problem, but, he needs to verify with someone. Become Churu's tester by computing the answer for each queries.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line contains T the number of test cases.\nFirst line of each test case contains N denoting the number of elements in list.\nSecond line of each test case contains Q denoting the number of queries in the assignment.\nNext line contains N space-seperated elements A[i]. \nNext Q lines contains a single element K, from the list.\n\nOutput\n\nVerify Churu's answers by computing the answer for each query\n\nConstraints and Subtasks\n\n1 <= T <= 5\n1 <= N, Q <= 1e6\n0 <= A[i] <= 1e6\n\nSubtask 1: 10 points\n\n1 <= N, Q <= 100\n\nSubtask 2: 15 points\n\n1 <= N, Q <= 10000\n\nSubtask 3: 75 points\n\noriginal constraints.\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n5 \n2\n2.300000 2.000000 1.001002 0.000000 10.000000\n0.000000\n2.000000\n\nOutput:\n4\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85adi28galaxyak\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CDVA1603\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, adi28galaxyak, binary-search, cdva16\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n3-02-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 - 5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
