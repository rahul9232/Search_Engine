b'\n\xc2\xa0\nVicky (Mr. Perfect) goes for shopping in a shopping mall with N shops to buy an item X. The shops in the shopping malls are in a single row and numbered from 0 to N-1. Each shop has total stock of Ai of the item X. He already knows the available stocks of X in each shop. He can buy any number of X from a shop. Due to his habit for perfection in every task, he will shop according to the following conditions:\n1. Vicky only buys either all the stock available in the shop or none of it.\n2. Vicky will select the shops in a manner such that all the shops are consecutive.\n3. Vicky will only shop if total number of X to be bought is multiple of N.\n4. Number of shops to be visited by him should be minimum.\n\nOne such solution is always possible. Print the starting shop(l) and ending shop(r). If multiple solutions are possible, then consider the solution with leftmost starting shop.\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nFirst line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nFor each testcase :\nFirst line contains a single integer N denoting number of shops in the mall. \nSecond line contains N space separated integers denoting array A, where Ai = number of item X available in ith shop.\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nFor each testcase, print two space separated integers l and r on each line.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n3\n4\n1 2 3 3\n6\n1 1 2 2 4 2\n5\n2 2 2 2 2\n\nOutput:\n1 3\n3 4\n0 4\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nFor the 2nd testcase, we can get solution for l=3 (A[3]=2) and r=4 (A[4]=4) following all the condition.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85daga_07\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PERFECT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, cobl2016, daga_07, simple\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-03-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
