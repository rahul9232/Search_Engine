The oldest child, Chefu, thinks that a distribution of money is fair only if an older child always receives more money than a younger child; if two children have the same age, they should receive the same amounts of money.\nFor each valid ii, the ii-th child is Ai years old and it received Ci units of money. Determine whether this distribution of money is fair.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains six space-separated integers A1, A2, A3, C1, C2 and C3.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "FAIR" if the distribution is fair or "NOT FAIR" otherwise.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A1,A2,A3\xe2\x89\xa417\n1\xe2\x89\xa4C1,C2,C3\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n5 7 10 10 20 50\n5 5 5 20 10 20\n10 1 17 5 10 15\n3 6 3 8 10 9\n8 5 5 50 10 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nFAIR\nNOT FAIR\nNOT FAIR\nNOT FAIR\nFAIR\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 2: All children have same age which is 5, but second child got less money than the other children, so it\'s not fair.\nExample case 3: First child is older than second child but he got less money than him, so it\'s not fair.\nExample case 4: First and third children have same age, but didn\'t get same amount of money,  so it\'s not fair.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EID2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1378\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-08-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
