b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a rooted tree with NN nodes labelled 11 through N. For each non-root node i, let's denote the direct parent of this node by pi.\nN cats, also labelled 1 through N, have vanished from Chef's home. The cats are frightened, so they want to climb the tree one by one, in the order C1,C2,\xe2\x80\xa6,CN. At any time, each node may contain at most one cat. When cat c wants to start climbing the tree, the following happens:\n\nIf there is already a cat in node c, then cat c leaves and decides to climb another tree. Otherwise, the cat makes a leap to node c.\nThen, while there is no cat in the parent of this cat's current node, the cat jumps to the parent of its current node. When it is impossible to jump any further (due to reaching the root or finding a cat in the parent node), the cat stays in its current node.\n\nFind the number of jumps performed by each cat (including the initial leap to the tree).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pN. The parent of the root will be denoted with a 0.\nThe third line contains N space-separated integers C1,C2,\xe2\x80\xa6,CN.\n\nOutput\nPrint N lines. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines should contain a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of jumps performed by cat Ci.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\nC1,C2,\xe2\x80\xa6,CN form a permutation of 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N\nthe graph described on the input is a tree\n\nExample Input\n10\n0 1 2 3 3 1 6 6 6 1\n5 6 3 4 2 1 7 8 9 10\n\nExample Output\n4\n1\n2\n2\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\nExample Input\n7\n2 4 0 3 3 3 4\n7 6 2 1 4 5 3\n\nExample Output\n3\n1\n2\n2\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85bciobanu\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CATS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DFS, Binary lifting\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals, Lowest Common Ancestor\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-02-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
