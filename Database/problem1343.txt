b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nChef decided to buy a new tablet. His budget is BB, so he cannot buy a tablet whose price is greater than BB. Other than that, he only has one criterion \xe2\x80\x94 the area of the tablet\'s screen should be as large as possible. Of course, the screen of a tablet is always a rectangle.\nChef has visited some tablet shops and listed all of his options. In total, there are NN available tablets, numbered 11 through NN. For each valid ii, the ii-th tablet has width WiWi, height HiHi and price PiPi.\nHelp Chef choose a tablet which he should buy and find the area of such a tablet\'s screen, or determine that he cannot buy any tablet.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and BB.\nNN lines follow. For each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the ii-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers WiWi, HiHi and PiPi.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line. If Chef cannot buy any tablet, it should contain the string "no tablet" (without quotes). Otherwise, it should contain a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum area of the screen of a tablet Chef can buy.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4B\xe2\x89\xa41,000,0001\xe2\x89\xa4B\xe2\x89\xa41,000,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41,000,0001\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41,000,000 for each valid ii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Wi,Hi\xe2\x89\xa410,0001\xe2\x89\xa4Wi,Hi\xe2\x89\xa410,000 for each valid ii\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3 6\n3 4 4\n5 5 7\n5 2 5\n2 6\n3 6 8\n5 4 9\n1 10\n5 5 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n12\nno tablet\n25\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The first tablet (with screen area 3\xe2\x8b\x854=123\xe2\x8b\x854=12) is the best option for Chef, since Chef cannot afford the second one and the third one has a smaller screen.\nExample case 2: Chef\'s budget is 66, but all tablets have higher prices, so Chef cannot buy any tablet.\nExample case 3: The price of the only tablet is exactly equal to Chef\'s budget, so he is able to buy it.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TABLET\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Conditional Statements, Brute Force, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Basic Programming Concepts, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1037\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-02-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
