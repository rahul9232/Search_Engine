Shahhoud posted a job offer on Chef Rami\'s paper "Fast Food Times".\nN candidates (numbered 1 through N) have applied for the job. There are M traits that define how good a chef is. You are given N strings S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SN describing the traits of the candidates. Each of these strings has length M. For each valid i and j, the j-th character of Si is \'1\' if the i-th chef has the j-th trait or \'0\' if this chef does not have this trait.\nShahhoud wants to choose a non-empty subsequence H (not necessarily contiguous) of the sequence (1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N) and hire all candidates from H. However, the sequence H must satisfy an additional condition: for any two consecutive elements of H (let\'s denote them by x and y), candidates x and y have no common traits, to prevent fights between them.\nNow, Shahhoud is wondering: how many such valid subsequences exist? Find this number modulo 1,000,000,007 (109+7).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nN lines follow. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the i-th of these lines contains a single string Si.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of valid subsequences modulo 1,000,000,007.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa416\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100,000\n|Si|=M for each valid i\nS1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SM contain only characters \'0\' and \'1\'\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 500,000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4 2\n10\n01\n11\n10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The valid subsequences are (1), (2), (3), (4), (1,2), (2,4) and (1,2,4).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85joudzouzou\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HIRING\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DP Approach, Meet in the middle\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2584\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-09-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
