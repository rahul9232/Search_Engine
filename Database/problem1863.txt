b'\nHacker-man\'s crew is trying to get into Swiss bank\'s locker, but in order to do so, hacker-man has to bypass a really tough laser lock.\nHe can see a square matrix with NN rows and NN columns. Inside it, he sees KK lasers in fixed coordinates. Each laser can be oriented vertically or horizontally, but not both. If placed horizontally, a laser will light up all cells in its row with distance at most dd from the laser\'s cell. If placed vertically, it will light up all cells in its column with distance at most d from the laser\'s cell. A laser always lights up its own cell, so the number of cells it will light up is always 2d+1 (including the ones lit outside the matrix).\nHacker-man can choose the orientation (horizontal or vertical) of each laser.\nIn order to bypass the lock, the lasers should be in such a configuration that no cell in the matrix is lit up by more than one laser. You should find one such configuration, or report that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nFor every test case:\nThe first line contains three space-separated integers, N, d, and K, where N is the length of one side of the square matrix, d is the maximum reach of a laser, and K is the number of lasers.\nEach of the next K lines contains two space-separated integers xi and yi denoting the coordinates of the i-th laser, where xi is the distance from the left edge and yi is the distance from the bottom edge.\n\nNote: No two lasers are at the same coordinates\nOutput\nFor each test case, print "Yes" or "No" (without quotes) depending on whether a configuration as described in the question is possible or not. If a configuration is possible, then in the next line print K space-separated integers representing the orientations of the K lasers respectively (0 for vertical and 1 for horizontal)\nCase is sensitive. For example, "yEs" and "NO" are incorrect.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (25 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4103 \n\nSubtask #2 (40 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa430\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85104\nThe sum of K over all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x85104 \n\nSubtask #3 (35 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\nThe sum of K over all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n    10 3 3\n    7 4\n    7 8\n    4 10\n    10 2 5\n    1 3\n    4 1\n    4 3\n    4 5\n    7 3\n    10 2 4\n    1 3\n    2 2\n    2 4\n    4 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYes\n    0 1 1\n    Yes\n    0 1 1 1 0\n    No\n\n\nExplanation\nNote: In the images below, the coordinates are given on a 2D plane, with (0, 0) being the bottom left corner\nTest Case 1:\nThe image below shows the positions of the lasers denoted by red dots.\n\nNow this second image shows the orientations of the lasers (satisfying the conditions).
