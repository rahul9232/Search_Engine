b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nChef has a box full of infinite number of identical coins. One day while playing, he made N piles each containing equal number of coins. Chef suddenly remembered an important task and left the room for sometime. While he was away, his newly hired assistant came across the piles and mixed them up while playing.\nWhen Chef returned home, he was angry to see that all of his piles didn't contain equal number of coins as he very strongly believes in the policy of equality for all, may it be people or piles of coins. \n In order to calm down the Chef, the assistant proposes to make all the piles equal. Chef agrees to give this task to him, but as a punishment gives him only two type of operations that he can perform.\n\nPick some coins from any pile and put them back in Chef's coin box.\nPick some coins from the Chef's coin box and put them on any one pile.\n \nThe assistant wants to do this task as fast as possible. So he wants to know the minimum number of operations needed to make all the piles equal.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of piles.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the number of coins in each pile.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the minimum number of operations assistant needs to do.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\nSub tasks\n\nSubtask #1: 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000 (30 points)\nSubtask #2: original constraints (70 points)\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4\n1 2 3 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nExplanation\n\nIn test case 1, if you decide to convert all the piles to contain either of 1, 2, 3, or 4 coins you will have to change the other 3 piles. For any other choice you will have to alter more than 3 (i.e. 4) piles.  \n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85abhra73\n\n\nTester:\n4\xe2\x98\x85pushkarmishra\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFEQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Frequency Arrays\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1386\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-01-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
