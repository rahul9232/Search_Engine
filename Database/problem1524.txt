b'\nAniket Verma aka Math Bond flaunts his mathematics skill whenever he gets the opportunity. But this time he gets into trouble when he meets Sakshi, another mathematician. Sakshi gave him a problem and asked him to solve. Help Aniket to solve the problem.\n\nGiven a number N, find the sum of all products x*y such that N/x = y (Integer Division).\nInput\nThe first line of input file contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contain an integer N.\nOutput\nOutput T lines containing answer to corresponding test case.\nSince the sum can be very large, you have to output this modulo 1000000007.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 500\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 109\nExample\nInput:\n3\n2\n3\n5\n\nOutput:\n4\n8\n21\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85giriraj\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GOC202\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, giriraj, mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-03-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
