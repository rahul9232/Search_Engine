b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nChef is on a vacation these days, so his friend Chefza is trying to solve Chef's everyday tasks.\nToday's task is to make a sweet roll. Rolls are made by a newly invented cooking machine. The machine is pretty universal - it can make lots of dishes and Chefza is thrilled about this.\nTo make a roll, Chefza has to set all the settings to specified integer values. There are lots of settings, each of them set to some initial value. The machine is pretty complex and there is a lot of cooking to be done today, so Chefza has decided to use only two quick ways to change the settings. In a unit of time, he can pick one setting (let's say its current value is v) and change it in one of the following ways.\n\nIf v is even, change this setting to v/2. If v is odd, change it to (v \xe2\x88\x92 1)/2.\nChange setting to 2 \xc3\x97 v\n\nThe receipt is given as a list of integer values the settings should be set to. It is guaranteed that each destination setting can be represented as an integer power of 2.\nSince Chefza has just changed his profession, he has a lot of other things to do. Please help him find the minimum number of operations needed to set up a particular setting of the machine. You can prove that it can be done in finite time.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers A and B denoting the initial and desired values of the setting, respectively.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing minimum number of operations Chefza has to perform in order to set up the machine.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 200\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 A \xe2\x89\xa4 107\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 B \xe2\x89\xa4 107, and B is an integer power of 2\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 [40 points]: A \xe2\x89\xa4 100 and B \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nSubtask #2 [60 points]: No additional constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n6\n1 1\n2 4\n3 8\n4 16\n4 1\n1 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n4\n2\n2\n2\n\n\nExplanation\n\nIn the first test case, you don't need to do anything.\nIn the second test case, you need to multiply 2 by 2 and get 4. This is done in 1 operation.\nIn the third test case, you need to obtain 1 from 3 and then multiply it by 2 three times to obtain 8. A total of 4 operations.\nIn the fourth test case, multiply 4 by 2 twice.\nIn the fifth test case, divide 4 by 2 twice.\nIn the sixth test case, multiply 1 by 2 twice.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85cenadar\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85laycurse\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COOKMACH\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, aug15, bitwise-operation, cakewalk, cenadar\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1329\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-05-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
