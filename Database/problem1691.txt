b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nThere is a garland \xe2\x80\x94 a cyclic rope with red and green flowers on it in some order. The sequence of flower colours is described by a string ss; since the rope is cyclic, each two consecutive flowers are adjacent and the first and last flower are also adjacent.\nThe garland is beautiful if there is no pair of adjacent flowers with identical colours.\nYou want the garland to be beautiful. To achieve that, you may perform the following operation at most once:\n\nMake two cuts on the rope (not intersecting the flowers), splitting the garland into two parts.\nReverse one of these two parts.\nTie together corresponding endpoints of the two parts, creating one whole garland again.\n\nCan you find out whether it is possible to make the garland beautiful?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string s describing the garland. Each character of s is either \'R\' or \'G\', denoting a red or green flower respectively.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "yes" if the garland can be made beautiful or "no" otherwise.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4|s|\xe2\x89\xa4105\nthe sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\nRG\nRRGG\nRR\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nyes\nyes\nno\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The garland is already beautiful.\nExample case 2: We can cut the garland between flowers 1 and 2 and between flowers 3 and 4. After reversing the part containing flowers 2 and 3 and rejoining, we obtain "RGRG".\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin2\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BEAUTGAR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 admin2, cook100, observation, simple, taran_1407\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1601\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-11-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
