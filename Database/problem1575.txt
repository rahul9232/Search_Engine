Also, Chef doesn't want to lose any water so he can increase the temperature to at most 100 degrees.\nAssuming no loss of water takes place during the process, find the maximum amount of sugar (in g) can be dissolved in 1 liter of water under the given conditions.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nThe only line of each test case contains three integers X,A,B. \n\nOutput\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the answer to the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n31\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa440\n101\xe2\x89\xa4A\xe2\x89\xa4120\n1\xe2\x89\xa4B\xe2\x89\xa45\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): Original Constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n40 120 1\n35 120 2\n40 115 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1800\n2500\n2950\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: Since solubility is increasing with temperature, the maximum solubility will be at 100 degrees which is equal to 120+(100\xe2\x88\x9240)=180g100\xc2\xa0mL. \nSo for 1 liter of water the value is 180\xe2\x8b\x8510=1800\xc2\xa0g.\nTest Case 2: Since solubility is increasing with temperature, the maximum solubility will be at 100 degrees which is equal to 120+(100\xe2\x88\x9235)\xe2\x8b\x852=250g100\xc2\xa0mL. \nSo for 1 liter of water the value is 250\xe2\x8b\x8510=2500\xc2\xa0g.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SOLBLTY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n922\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-05-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
