b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\n\nThere are N+1 lights. Lights are placed at  (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0) ... (N, 0). Initially all the lights are on. You want to turn off all of them one after one.  You want to follow a special pattern in turning off the lights. \n\n\nYou will start at (0, 0). First, you walk to the right most light that is on, turn it off. Then you walk to the left most light that is on, turn it off. Then again to the right most light that is on and so on. You will stop after turning off all lights. You want to know how much distance you walked in the process. Note that distance between (a,0) and (b,0) is |a-b|.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case has a single integer N on separate line.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the distance you walked.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5\n\n\nExplanation\nTestcase #2\nYou are initially at (0, 0)\nRight most on-light is (2, 0). Distance = 2.\nNow you are at (2, 0).\nLeft most on-light is (0, 0). Distance = 2.\nNow you are at (0, 0)\nRight most on-light is (1, 0). Distance = 1.\nNow you are at (1, 0) and all lights are turned off.\nTotal distance walked = 5.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85anudeep2011\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kostya_by\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ANUWTA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bottom-up, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, DP Approach, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1374\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-09-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
