b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\n\xc2\xa0\n Yesterday Chef had a great party and doesn't remember the way he celebreated it. But he found a strange paper in his kitchen containing n digits (lets give them indices from 1 to n and name them a1, a2 ... aN). \n Chef remembers that he played such game:\n On each step he choose an index x from 1 to n.\n For all indices y (y < x) he calculated the difference by = ax - ay. \n Then he calculated B1 - sum of all by which are greater than 0 and B2 - sum of all by which are less than 0. \n The answer for this step is B1 - B2. \n\n\nChef remembers the game, but forgot the answer. Please, help him!\n\nInput\nThe first line contains two integers n, m denoting the number of digits and number of steps. The second line contains n digits (without spaces) a1, a2, ..., an. \n Each of next m lines contains single integer x denoting the index for current step. \n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nFor each of m steps print single number in a line - answer of the step.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n, m \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 ai \xe2\x89\xa4 9\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 x \xe2\x89\xa4 n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n10 3\n0324152397\n1\n4\n7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n7\n9\n\n\nExplanation\nFor index 1 there are no indexes which are less, so B1 = B2 = 0 and the answer is 0.\nFor index 4 we have \n\nb1 = 4-0=4, \nb2 = 4-3=1, \nb3 = 4-2=2, \n\nso B1 = 4+1+2 = 7, B2 = 0 \nand the answer is 7.\nFor index 7 we have\n\nb1 = 2-0=2, \nb2 = 2-3=-1, \nb3 = 2-2=0, \nb4 = 2-4=-2, \nb5 = 2-1=1, \nb6 = 2-5=-3, \n\nso B1 = 2 + 1 = 3,\n     B2 = -1 -2 -3 = -6 \nand the answer is 9.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nberezin\n\n\nTester:\n2\xe2\x98\x85shiplu\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ADIGIT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Frequency Arrays, Pre processing, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Advanced Algorithms, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1614\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-02-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
