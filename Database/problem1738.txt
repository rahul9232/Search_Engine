The rows are numbered 1 through N from top to bottom and the columns are numbered 1 through M from left to right.\nAnas wants to destroy this grid. To do that, he wants to send two heroes from the top left cell to the bottom right cell:\n\nThe first hero visits cells in row-major order: (1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(1,2)\xe2\x86\x92\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x86\x92(1,M)\xe2\x86\x92(2,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,2)\xe2\x86\x92\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x86\x92(2,M)\xe2\x86\x92\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x86\x92(N,M).\nThe second hero visits cells in column-major order: (1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,1)\xe2\x86\x92\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x86\x92(N,1)\xe2\x86\x92(1,2)\xe2\x86\x92(2,2)\xe2\x86\x92\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x86\x92(N,2)\xe2\x86\x92\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x86\x92(N,M).\n\nWe know that each hero destroys the first cell he visits, rests in the next K cells he visits without destroying them, then destroys the next cell he visits, rests in the next K cells, destroys the next cell, and so on until he reaches (and rests in or destroys) the last cell he visits.\nAnas does not know the value of K. Therefore, for each value of K between 0 and N\xe2\x8b\x85M\xe2\x88\x921 inclusive, he wants to calculate the number of cells that will be destroyed by at least one hero. Can you help him?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing N\xe2\x8b\x85M space-separated integers as described above.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nthe sum of N\xe2\x8b\x85M over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa450\nthe sum of N\xe2\x8b\x85M over all test cases does not exceed 5,000\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n6 4 3 3 2 1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nK=0: All cells will be destroyed by the heroes.\nK=1: The first hero will destroy the cells [(1,1),(1,3),(2,2)], while the second one will destroy the cells [(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)].\nK=2: The first hero will destroy the cells [(1,1),(2,1)], while the second one will destroy the cells [(1,1),(2,2)].\nK=3: The first hero will destroy the cells [(1,1),(2,2)], while the second one will destroy the cells [(1,1),(1,3)].\nK=4: The first hero will destroy the cells [(1,1),(2,3)] and the second one will also destroy the cells [(1,1),(2,3)].\nK=5 : The first hero will destroy the cell (1,1) and the second one will also destroy the cell (1,1).\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85i_love_islam\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DESTCELL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sieve of Eratosthenes\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2297\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-08-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
