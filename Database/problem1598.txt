In order to claim the prize in a particular category the person must cover the total distance for that category within D days. Also a single person cannot apply in multiple categories. \nGiven the maximum distance d km that Chef can cover in a single day, find the maximum prize that Chef can win at the end of D days. If Chef can't win any prize, print 0.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nEach test case contains a single line of input, five integers D,d,A,B,C. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A<B<C\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1 1 1 2 3\n10 1 1 2 3\n10 3 1 2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: The maximum distance covered by Chef is 1\xe2\x8b\x851=1 km which is less than any of the available distance categories. Hence Chef won't be able to claim a prize in any of the categories.\nTest Case 2: The maximum distance covered by Chef is 10\xe2\x8b\x851=10 km which is equal to distance of the first category. Hence Chef can claim the maximum prize of 1 units.\nTest Case 3: The maximum distance covered by Chef is 10\xe2\x8b\x853=30 km which is more than the distance of the second category but less than that of the third category. Hence Chef can claim the maximum prize of 2 units.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MARARUN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Conditional Statements, Basic Maths\n                 \n                     \n                     Basic Programming Concepts, Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n955\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-05-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
