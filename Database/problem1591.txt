b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nAppy and Chef are participating in a contest. There are NN problems in this contest; each problem has a unique problem code between 11 and NN inclusive. Appy and Chef decided to split the problems to solve between them \xe2\x80\x95 Appy should solve the problems whose problem codes are divisible by A but not divisible by B, and Chef should solve the problems whose problem codes are divisible by B but not divisible by A (they decided to not solve the problems whose codes are divisible by both A and B).\nTo win, it is necessary to solve at least K problems. You have to tell Appy whether they are going to win or lose.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers N, A, B and K.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "Win" if they can solve at least K problems or "Lose" otherwise (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa415\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41018\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (15 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa415\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\nSubtask #2 (85 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6 2 3 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nWin\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Appy is solving the problems with codes 2 and 4, Chef is solving the problem with code 3. Nobody is solving problem 6, since 6 is divisible by both 2 and 3. Therefore, they can solve 3 problems and win.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85hmrockstar\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HMAPPY2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, GCD, LCM, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1358\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-01-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
