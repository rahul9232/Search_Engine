We are going to fold it in the following way:\n\npick up the right side of the piece of cardboard and move it to the left until it touches the left side\nthis way, a smaller piece of cardboard with width 1/21/2 is created; if we unfolded it, we could see a vertical ridge formed in the middle\npick up the left side of this new piece of cardboard and move it to the right until it touches the (new) right side\npick up the right side of the resulting piece of cardboard and move it to the left until it touches the left side, etc.\n\nWhenever the cardboard is folded, exactly one of its new sides is a newly formed ridge (there may be more, internal ridges formed, but we do not consider these). Let's denote such a ridge created in the k-th folding by Rk.\nIn total, we fold the piece of cardboard N times. Afterwards, we unfold it and look at the formed ridges. Let's denote the distance of ridge RN (i.e. the last formed outer ridge) from the left side of the original piece of cardboard by DN. For example, D1=1/2 and D2=1/4.\nIt is possible to express DN as an irreducible fraction x/y. Find this fraction.\nAssume that it is possible to fold the piece of cardboard as many times as we want.\nInput\nThe first and only line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, a space and an integer N follows.\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing 2T space-separated integers. For the i-th test case (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4T), the 2i\xe2\x88\x921-th and 2i-th integer should denote x and y \xe2\x80\x94 the position of the last ridge as an irreducible fraction.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa425\n\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\n\nSubtask #2 (90 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 2 1 4\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We only fold once, so x=1 and y=2.\nExample case 2: We fold the piece of cardboard twice.
