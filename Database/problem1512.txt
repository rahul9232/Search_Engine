b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a uniformly randomly generated string S, consisting of letters from the set {"A", "B"}. Your task is to find a string T that appears in S as a subsequence exactly twice.\nIn other words, you need to find such a string T, that there exist exactly two sets of indexes i1, i2, ..., i|T| and j1, j2, ..., j|T| such that there exists some k, where  ik \xe2\x89\xa0 jk and S{i1...i|T|} = S{j1...j|T|} = T.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string S.\nThe string S was generated randomly. For a generating string S, we first choose an integer N denoting a length of S. After that every symbol of the string S is chosen randomly from the set {"A", "B"} and the both symbols have equal probability to be chosen.\xc2\xa0Note that N is not choosen randomly.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a string that occurs exactly twice as a subsequence in S, or output -1 if there is no such string. If there are more than one possible subsequences occurring exactly two times, you can print any one of them.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (10 points): 2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 3\nSubtask #2 (26 points): 2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10\nSubtask #3 (64 points): 2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 5000\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\nAAAA\nBAB\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n-1\nB\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case #1: \n\nThe string "AAAA" appears once as a subsequence in itself.\nThe string "AAA" appears four times as a subsequence in "AAAA"; possible positions: {2, 3, 4}, {1, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 2, 3}.\nThe strings "AA" and "A" also appear in "AAAA" as a subsequence strictly more than twice. \n\nSo, there is no string of "AAAA", which appears exactly twice. Hence answer is -1.\nTest case #2: Two occurrences of "B" in "BAB" are {1} and {3} (1-based indexing).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsergey_adm\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85zedthirtyeight\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ABABAABA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2322\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-02-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
