b'\nThere is a matrix of size N\xc3\x97MN\xc3\x97M. Two distinct cells of the matrix (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and (x2,y2)(x2,y2) are painted with colors 11 and 22 respectively.\nYou have to paint the remaining cells of the matrix such that:\n\nNo two adjacent cells are painted in same color. \nEach color is an integer from 11 to 109109 (both inclusive).\nThe number of distinct colors used is minimum (including 11 and 22). \n\nNote: \n\nYou cannot repaint the cells (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and (x2,y2)(x2,y2).\nTwo cells are adjacent if they share a common edge. Thus, for a cell (x,y)(x,y) there are 44 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (x,y+1),(x,y\xe2\x88\x921),(x+1,y),(x,y+1),(x,y\xe2\x88\x921),(x+1,y), and (x\xe2\x88\x921,y)(x\xe2\x88\x921,y).\n\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of 33 lines.\nThe first line contains two space seperated integers NN and MM denoting the dimensions of the matrix.\nThe second line contains two integers x1x1 and y1y1, denoting the coordinates of cell which is painted 11.\nThe third line contains two integers x2x2 and y2y2, denoting the coordinates of cell which is painted 22.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output NN lines, each consisting of MM space separated integers where jthjth integer in ithith line denotes the color of cell in ithith row and jthjth column of the matrix and must be in [1,109][1,109] inclusive.\nIn case of multiple possible answers, output any.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41052\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x1,x2\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4x1,x2\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4y1,y2\xe2\x89\xa4M1\xe2\x89\xa4y1,y2\xe2\x89\xa4M\n(x1,y1)\xe2\x89\xa0(x2,y2)(x1,y1)\xe2\x89\xa0(x2,y2)\nSum of N\xe2\x8b\x85MN\xe2\x8b\x85M over all test cases does not exceed 105105.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2 2\n1 1\n2 2\n2 3\n1 1\n1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 4\n4 2\n1 2 1\n2 1 2\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 11:\n\nThe initially painted cells are (1,1)(1,1) and (2,2)(2,2). One possible way is to paint the remaining cells with color 44. This way, no two adjacent cells have the same color.\nNote that, instead of color 44, we can use any other color in the range [1,109][1,109] except colors 11 and 22.\nThe number of distinct colors used in this case is 33. It can be shown that the minimum number of distinct colors cannot be less than 33.\nTest Case 22:\n\nThe initially painted cells are (1,1)(1,1) and (1,2)(1,2). One possible way is to paint the remaining cells as shown in the figure. This way, no two adjacent cells have the same color.\nThe number of distinct colors used in this case is 22. It can be shown that the minimum number of distinct colors cannot be less than 22.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85kugo\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MINCOLOR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, easy, kugo, start30\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1713\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-03-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
