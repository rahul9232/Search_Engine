She constructed it from a sequence of positive integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN in the following way: for each valid ii, Fi=\xe2\x88\x91ij=1(\xe2\x88\x921)(j+1)\xe2\x8b\x85Aj.\nUnfortunately, Chef was playing with the sequence F and shuffled it. Now, he has a sequence denoted by B, but he does not remember F. The only things he knows are that F is a permutation of B and among all such permutations which Chefina could have constructed, her sequence F was the lexicographically smallest.\nChef does not want to disappoint Chefina, but he is too busy in the kitchen, so he asked you to help him recover F. Find the sequence F he got from Chefina or determine that he made another mistake and a sequence that satisfies the given conditions does not exist.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf there is no solution, print a single line containing the string "NO" (without quotes).\nOtherwise, print two lines.\nThe first of these lines should contain the string "YES" (without quotes).\nThe second line should contain N space-separated integers F1,F2,\xe2\x80\xa6,FN.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n|Bi|\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN are pairwise distinct\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2\n1 2\n3\n-1 -2 -3\n4\n3 3 3 4\n4\n4 -4 4 -4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n2 1\nNO\nNO\nYES\n4 -4 4 -4\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The only two permutations of B are [1,2] and [2,1]. Out of them, [1,2] could not have been generated by Chefina, since it would require A=[1,\xe2\x88\x921], which contains a negative element. On the other hand, for [2,1], we get A=[2,1], so F=[2,1] must be the sequence Chefina generated.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85dean_student\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RESTCH\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Multiset, Segment Trees, Greedy, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Sets, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3220\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
