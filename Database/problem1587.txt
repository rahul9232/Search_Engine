Today, he has got the latest song which is in total SS minutes long. He is interested to know how many times will he be able to play the song completely.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nThe only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers M,S - the duration of the trip and the duration of the song, both in minutes.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa410\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n10 5\n10 6\n9 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n\nExplanation\n\nTest case 1: Chef listens to the song once from 0\xe2\x88\x925 minutes and next from 5\xe2\x88\x9210 minutes.\nTest case 2: Chef listens to the song from 0\xe2\x88\x926 minutes but now he has only 4 minutes left so he can't complete the song again.\nTest case 3: Since the song lasts longer than the journey, Chef won't be able to complete it even once.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SLOOP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n854\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-04-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
