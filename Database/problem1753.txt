There are NN cities (numbered 11 through N) on this planet; let's denote the value of city i by vi. Firdavs can travel directly from each city to any other city. When he travels directly from city x to city y, he needs to pay f(x,y)=|vy\xe2\x88\x92vx|+y\xe2\x88\x92x coins (this number can be negative, in which case he receives \xe2\x88\x92f(x,y) coins).\nLet's define a simple path from city x to city y with length k\xe2\x89\xa51 as a sequence of cities a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ak such that all cities in this sequence are different, a1=x and ak=y. The cost of such a path is \xe2\x88\x91k\xe2\x88\x921i=1f(ai,ai+1).\nYou need to answer some queries for Firdavs. In each query, you are given two cities x and y, and you need to find the minimum cost of a simple path from city x to city y. Then, you need to find the length of the longest simple path from x to y with this cost.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vN.\nThe following Q lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers x and y.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing two space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum cost and the maximum length.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe sum of N in all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of Q in all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nv1<v2<\xe2\x80\xa6<vN\nthe sum of N in all test cases does not exceed 5,000\nthe sum of Q in all test cases does not exceed 5,000\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4 2\n4 2 5 7\n2 3\n3 4\n2 1\n1 1\n2 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4 3\n3 2\n-1 2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: For the first query, there are two paths with cost 4 from city 2 to city 3:\n\n2\xe2\x86\x921\xe2\x86\x923: cost (|4\xe2\x88\x922|+1\xe2\x88\x922)+(|5\xe2\x88\x924|+3\xe2\x88\x921)=4, length 3\n2\xe2\x86\x923: cost |5\xe2\x88\x922|+3\xe2\x88\x922=4, length 2\n\nAll other paths have greater costs, so the minimum cost is 4. Among these two paths, we want the one with greater length, which is 3.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85farhod_farmon\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FAPF\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Binary Search, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Searching, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2132\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-04-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
