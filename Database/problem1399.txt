b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n\nEvery Friday Chef and his N - 1 friends go for a party. At these parties, they play board games. This Friday, they are playing a game named "Boats! Boats! Boats!". In this game players have to transport cookies between Venice and Constantinople. Each player has a personal storage. The players are numbered from 1 to N, Chef is numbered 1. Rules for determining a winner are very difficult, therefore Chef asks you to write a program, which will determine who is a winner. \n\n\nThere are 6 types of cookies. For each cookie in the storage player gets 1 point. Also player gets additional points if he packs his cookies in some boxes as follows: \nA box containing 4 different types of cookies fetches 1 additional point.\nA box containing 5 different types of cookies fetches 2 additional points.\nA box containing 6 different types of cookies fetches 4 additional points.\n\n\nObviously a cookie can be put into a single box.\n\n\n\nFor each player, you know the number of cookies in his storage (denoted by c[i]), also the types of cookies in the storage given denoted by type[i][j].\n\nYour task is to determine the winner of this game. Output "tie" if there are two or more players with same maximum score, "chef" if only Chef has a maximum score, winner\'s index in all other cases.\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. This will be followed by T test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of players.\nThe second line of each test case contains an integer c[i] denoting the number of cookies in the i-th storage, followed by c[i] space-separated integers type[i][j] which denote the type if j-th cookie in the storage i-th.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer as specified in the statement.\nConstraints and Subtasks\nSubtask #1 : (20 points) \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4  N  \xe2\x89\xa4 100  \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4  c[i]  \xe2\x89\xa4  100  \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4  type[i][j]  \xe2\x89\xa4  3  \nSubtask #2 : (80 points) \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4  N  \xe2\x89\xa4 100  \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4  c[i]  \xe2\x89\xa4  100  \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4  type[i][j]  \xe2\x89\xa4  6  \n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n6 1 2 3 4 5 6\n9 3 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 5\n2\n5 2 3 4 5 6\n7 1 1 2 2 3 3 4\n3\n4 1 1 2 3\n4 1 2 2 3\n4 1 2 3 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nchef\n2\ntie\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.\nChef has total 6 cookie, so he gets 6 points for that. Also, he can put all his cookies (as they are all distinct) in a bag of size 6. It will fetch him additional 4 points. So, Chef\'s total points will be 10.\nThe second player has 9 cookies, he gets 9 points for that. Other than this, he can\'t create a bag with either 4, 5 or 6 distinct cookies. So, his final score is 9.\n10 > 9 - Chef wins.\nExample case 2.\nChef has 5 + 2 (a bag with 5 different cookies) = 7.\nThe second player has 7 + 1(a bag with 4 different cookies) = 8.\n7 < 8 - the second player wins.\nExample case 3.\nEvery player has 4 cookies and can\'t create any bag of sweets. So, it\'s a tie.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85omelyanenko\n\n\nTester:\n5\xe2\x98\x85dpraveen\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RESCALC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, Bitmasking, Bitwise Operation, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Bit Manipulation, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1571\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-07-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
