b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef and his friend Chefu decided to go on a trip. The trip takes place over the next NN days (numbered 1 through NN). There are KK different places Chef and Chefu could visit (numbered 1 through K). They have written a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN which denotes the plan of the trip during these N days; however, the plan is not completed yet. For each valid i, they want to visit the place Ai on the i-th day, but if Ai=\xe2\x88\x921, then they haven\'t decided which place to visit on that day.\nChef and his friend do not want to visit the same place two days in a row, but they can visit a place more than once in total. It is not necessary to visit all the places during the trip. Determine whether it is possible to complete the plan in such a way that this condition is satisfied. If it is possible, find one way of completing the plan.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a line containing the string "YES" if it\'s possible the complete the plan or "NO" otherwise.\nIf it\'s possible to complete the plan, print a second line containing N space-separated integers denoting the sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN after completing the plan. If there is more than one solution, you may print any one.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4K or Ai=\xe2\x88\x921 for each valid i\nif Ai\xe2\x89\xa0\xe2\x88\x921 and Ai+1\xe2\x89\xa0\xe2\x88\x921, then Ai\xe2\x89\xa0Ai+1, for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nK=2\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 10,000\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n5 3\n-1 -1 -1 -1 -1\n4 5\n1 2 3 5\n3 2\n1 -1 2\n4 2\n1 -1 -1 1\n6 4\n-1 -1 4 -1 2 -1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n1 2 1 2 1\nYES\n1 2 3 5\nNO\nNO\nYES\n1 2 4 1 2 1\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TRIP2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Constructive\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2056\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-08-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
