b'\nRead problems statements Mandarin , Bengali , Hindi , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are two people walking along a tree with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN), each of them with speed 1 edge per second.\nThe walk of the first person is described by a sequence of nodes u1,u2,\xe2\x80\xa6,uK. This person appears in node u1 at time 0 and walks to node u2 using the shortest path; then, immediately after reaching u2, walks to node u3 using the shortest path, and so on, until reaching uK, when this person disappears.\nThe walk of the second person is described by another sequence v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vL in the same manner.\nCount how many times these two people meet \xe2\x80\x94 in other words, how many times they reach the same node (including the first and last nodes of their walks) at the same time.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, K and L.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers p and q describing an edge between node p and node q.\nThe following line contains K space-separated integers u1,u2,\xe2\x80\xa6,uK.\nThe last line contains L space-separated integers v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vL.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of times the two people meet.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N,K,L\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4p,q\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\nui\xe2\x89\xa0ui+1 for each valid i\nvi\xe2\x89\xa0vi+1 for each valid i\nthe sum of N in all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of K in all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of L in all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N,K,L\xe2\x89\xa4103\nthe sum of N in all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85103\nthe sum of K in all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85103\nthe sum of L in all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85103\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5 4 3\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n4 5\n1 4 3 5\n1 3 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TREEWLK2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Case work, Lowest Common Ancestor, Binary lifting\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Special, Algorithms, Graph Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3165\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-10-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
