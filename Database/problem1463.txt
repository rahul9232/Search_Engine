b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\n\nMike likes strings. He is also interested in algorithms. A few days ago he discovered for himself a very nice problem:\n\n\nYou are given an AB-string S. You need to count the number of substrings of S, which have an equal number of \'A\'-s and \'B\'-s.\n\n\nDo you know how to solve it? Good. Mike will make the problem a little bit more difficult for you.\n\n\nYou are given an ABC-string S. You need to count the number of substrings of S, which have an equal number of \'A\'-s, \'B\'-s and \'C\'-s.\n\n\nA string is called AB-string if it doesn\'t contain any symbols except \'A\' or \'B\'. A string is called ABC-string if it doesn\'t contain any symbols except \'A\', \'B\' or \'C\'.\n\nInput\n \nThe first line of the input contains an ABC-string S.\nOutput\nYour output should contain the only integer, denoting the number of substrings of S, which have an equal number of \'A\'-s, \'B\'-s and \'C\'-s.\n\nThe answer can go above a 32-bit integer. Please, use 64-bit integers for storing and processing data.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4  1 000 000; where |S| denotes the length of the given ABC-string.\nExample\nInput:\nABACABA\n\nOutput:\n2\n\n \nExplanation\n\nIn the example you should count S[2..4] = "BAC" and S[4..6] = "CAB".\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kostya_by\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85gerald\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ABCSTR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Maps, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2264\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-02-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
