b"\nThere is a binary string SS. Alice and Bob are playing a game on it.\nEach turn, the following happens:\n\nAlice selects a 0101 subsequence in S and removes it from S. (a 01 subsequence is a length 2 subsequence whose first character is 0 and second character is 1)\nBob selects a 01 subsequence in S and removes it from S.\nAfter both players have moved, the turn is called completed and Alice scores 1 point. Then, the next turn begins.\n\nIf either player is unable to move (there isn't any 01 subsequence left in S), that turn ends immediately and the game ends.\nAlice tries to maximize her points, while Bob tries to minimize Alice's points. Find how many points Alice would score if both players play optimally.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer T \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. \nEach of the next T lines contains a binary string S.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output on a new line a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 Alice's score when both players play optimally.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\nThe sum of |S| across all tests doesn't exceed  2\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (25 Points):\nThe sum of |S| across all tests doesn't exceed 100\nSubtask 2 (25 Points):\nThe sum of |S| across all tests doesn't exceed 1500\nSubtask 3 (50 Points):\nNo further constraints.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n01010101\n0101\n10\n01001011\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 \n1 \n0 \n2 \n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first example, this is one of the possible outcomes.\nTurn 1:\n\nAlice removes subsequence (1,2) from S, so S becomes 010101.\nBob removes subsequence (3,6) from S, so S becomes 0110.\nAlice scores one point and the first turn ends.\n\nTurn 2:\n\nAlice removes subsequence (1,2) from S, so S becomes 10.\nBob has nothing to do, so the game ends immediately.\n\nThus, Alice has one point in total.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndannyboy1204\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BSG\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n4015\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-05-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
