b'\n"The Mean Absolute Difference is a measure of statistical dispersion equal to the average absolute difference of two independent values drawn from a probability distribution." - Wikipedia \n In this problem we are concerned not with Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) of two distributions but rather with the Summed Absolute Difference (SAD) of two arrays. Given arrays (1-indexed) P and Q of lengths p and q, define\n\n\n Given a collection of K arrays A1, ..., AK, report SAD(Ai, Aj) for several queries (i, j). \nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains a single positive integer K.\nEach of the next K lines starts with a positive integer si, the size of Ai, followed by si space-separated integers Ai,1, ..., Ai,si which denotes the array Ai. \n The next line of input consists of a single positive integer M. \n Each of the next M lines consists of 2 positive integers i and j which lie between 1 and K (inclusive), specifying the indices of the arrays for which the SAD value must be reported.\n\nOutput\nOutput M lines. Line i should contain the answer to query i.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K, M \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 s1 + ... + sK \xe2\x89\xa4  105\n-109 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai,j \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i, j \xe2\x89\xa4 K in each of the queries\n\nExample\nInput:\n4\n4 0 3 1 -2 \n2 0 4 \n2 2 4 \n4 4 -3 -4 4 \n3\n3 4\n4 2\n1 4\n\nOutput:\n30\n30\n60\n\nExplanation:\nQuery 1: The arrays in question are A3 = [2, 4] and A4 = [4, -3, -4, 4].\n\nSAD(A3, A4) = |2 - 4| + | 2 - (-3) | + |2 - (-4) | + | 2 - 4 | + | 4 - 4 | + | 4 - (-3) | + | 4 - (-4) | + | 4 - 4 | \n                       = 2 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 0 + 7 + 8 + 0 \n                       = 30\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85architk\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SADQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Pre processing, HLD, Sorting, Binary Search, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Algorithms, Searching, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-12-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
