b'\nAndrew likes meatballs very much as you know.\nHe has N plates of meatballs, here the ith plate contains exactly i meatballs. Andrew wants to take exactly K plates to his trip to Las Vegas.\nOn this occasion, he wants to choose the K plates by a strange way: if both ith and jth plates are chosen, then i and j must not be relative prime, for all 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i < j \xe2\x89\xa4 N.\nPlease help him to choose K plates. Output one of the possible choices.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output K distinct integers, denoting the number of selected plates, where the plates are numbered from 1 to N. If there are multiple solutions, any one will do. If it is impossible to choose K plates, print only one integer -1.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 7\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 777\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n100 3\n100 100\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n45 63 35\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: One of the possible choices is that he takes 45th plate, 63rd plate, and 35th plate. BecauseGCD(45, 63) = 9,GCD(45, 35) = 5,GCD(63, 35) = 7.\nExample case 2: He must choose all N = K plates in this case. But, for example, the pair of 3rd plate and 5th plate does not satisfy his desire. So it is impossible to choose K plates.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85witaliy_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85laycurse\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/AMMEAT2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 GCD, Pigeonhole Principle\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Set Theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1597\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-04-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
