b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian \nChef is going to participate in a new quiz show: "Who dares to be a millionaire?"\nAccording to the rules of the game, contestants must answer N questions. The quiz being famous for its difficulty, each question has 26 candidate answers, but only one of which is correct. Answers are denoted by capital Latin letters from A to Z. Chef knows all the questions that can be asked, and for each of them he knows the answer candidate he will choose (some of them can be incorrect). For each question, we\'ll tell you Chef\'s answer to it.\nThe game goes on as follows. First, all the questions are shuffled randomly. Then, a contestant is asked these questions one-by-one in the new shuffled order. If the contestant answers any question incorrectly, the game is over. Total winnings of the contestant are calculated as follows. Let X denote the number of questions answered correctly by the contestant. Depending on this value, the winnings are determined: W0 dollars is the amount won for X = 0, W1 dollars is for X = 1, and so on till X = N. Note that the game was invented by a twisted mind, and so a case where Wi \xe2\x89\xa5 Wi + 1 for some 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x88\x92 1 is possible.\nChef is interested in finding the maximum possible winnings that he can amass.\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The  description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of questions.\nNext line contains N capital Latin letters denoting the correct answers to these questions.\nNext line contains N capital Latin letters denoting answers given by Chef to these questions.\nNext line contains N + 1 space-separated integers W0, W1, ..., WN denoting the winnings for 0, 1, ..., N correct answers.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the value of maximum possible winnings that Chef can get.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 500\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Wi \xe2\x89\xa4 109\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1: (20 points)\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 8\nSubtask 2: (80 points)\nOriginal constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5\nABCDE\nEBCDA\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n4\nCHEF\nQUIZ\n4 3 2 1 0\n8\nABBABAAB\nABABABAB\n100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n30\n4\n100\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. If questions will be placed in order: 2nd (Chef\'s answer is B, which is correct), 3rd (Chef\'s answer is C, and it is correct as well), 4th (Chef\'s answer is D, and he is right), 5th (Chef\'s answer is A but correct answer is E and the game is over), 1st, Chef will correctly answer 3 questions, and therefore win 30 dollars.\nExample case 2. Chef\'s answers for all questions are incorrect, so his winnings are W0 dollars.\nExample case 3. Since all Wi are equal to 100 dollars, Chef will win this sum in any possible case.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85eartemov\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/WDTBAM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Case work, Conditional Statements, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Basic Programming Concepts, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1497\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-07-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
