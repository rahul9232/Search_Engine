b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nAlice and Bob, both have to drink water. But they both don't want to go, so they will play a game to decide who will fetch water for both of them. Alice will choose a number randomly between 1 and N (both inclusive) and Bob will choose a number randomly between 1 and M (both inclusive). Both will write their numbers on a slip of paper. If sum of numbers choosen by both is odd, then Alice will go, else Bob will go.\nWhat is probability that Alice will go?\n\nInput\nFirst line contains, T, the number of testcases. Each testcase consists of N and M in one line, separated by a space.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing probability as an irreducible fraction.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N,M \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1 1\n1 2\n2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0/1\n1/2\n1/2\n\n\nExplanation\n#test1: The only way is when Alice and Bob both choose 1. So, Alice won't have to go because sum is even.\n#test2: The different ways are (1,1) and (1,2), where first term denotes the number choosen by Alice. So of all possible cases (ie. 2) in only 1 case Alice has to go. Therefore, probability is 1/2.\n#test3: The different ways are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) where first term denotes the number choosen by Alice. So of all possible cases (ie. 6) in only 3 cases Alice has to go. Therefore, probability is 1/2.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85darkshadows\n\n\nTester:\n2\xe2\x98\x85shiplu\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GUESS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, combinatorics, darkshadows, june14, simple\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1410\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-04-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
