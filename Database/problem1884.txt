A data pipeline takes data from some source stream(s), processes this data and sends it to output stream(s).\nCodechef Beam is an example of such a pipeline. This pipeline takes data from NsNs source streams and it is expected to send data to NoeNoe output streams. However, the actual number of output streams may be different.\nInternally, Beam calculates a parameter K=\xe2\x8c\x88Ns/Noe\xe2\x8c\x89K=\xe2\x8c\x88Ns/Noe\xe2\x8c\x89: the maximum number of source streams that may be sent to a single output stream. Then, output streams are created. The first K input streams are assigned to one output stream, the next K input streams to a second output stream and so on, until there are less than K unassigned input streams. Then, if the number of unassigned input streams is positive, another output stream is created and all those unassigned input streams are assigned to it. For example, for Ns=35, Noe=20, we have K=2 and the actual number of output streams is 18: 17 output streams taking 2 input streams each and one output stream taking 1 input stream.\nYou are given Noe, the maximum possible number of input streams M and the desired final number of output streams Nof. Find the number of integers x from 1 to M (inclusive) such that if Ns=x, Codechef Beam sends data to exactly Nof output streams.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers M, Noe and Nof.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of possible values of Ns satisfying the given criteria.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M,Noe,Nof\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n40 20 18\n40 20 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The number of input streams Ns can be 18, 35 or 36.\nExample case 2: The number of input streams must be 5, since the number of output streams cannot be 5 otherwise.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin2\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DATAPIPE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 AP, Patterns\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Sequences and Progression, Algorithms, Observation\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3079\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-10-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
