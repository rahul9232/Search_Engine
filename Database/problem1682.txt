b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nYou are given a grid with size N\xc3\x97M. Each cell of this grid contains either 0 or 1.\nWe should perform the following operation until the size of the grid becomes 1\xc3\x971:\n\nSuppose the present size of the grid is x\xc3\x97y.\nChoose one of the x\xe2\x88\x921 horizontal lines or y\xe2\x88\x921 vertical lines crossing the grid.\nFold the grid along this line. For each pair of cells which overlap after this folding, replace them by a single cell such that the value in this cell is the XOR of the values in the two overlapping cells. Thus, we obtain a new grid.\n\nExample: If the initial grid is\n000\n111\n010\n\n1) After folding along 1-st horizontal line, the grid is\n111\n010\n\n2) After folding along the 2-nd vertical line, the grid is\n10\n01\n\n3) After folding along the 1-st horizontal line, the grid is\n11\n\n4) After folding along the 1-st vertical line, the grid is\n0\n\nDetermine whether there is a sequence of folds such that in the final 1\xc3\x971 grid, the only cell contains 1.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nN lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains a single binary string Si with length M describing the i-th row of the grid.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to obtain 1 in the final 1\xc3\x971 grid or "NO" if it is impossible (without quotes).\nYou may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x8b\x85M\xe2\x89\xa4105\neach character of each string is \'0\' or \'1\'\nthe sum of N\xe2\x8b\x85M over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1 2\n01\n3 3\n000\n111\n010\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There is only 1 possible move, which is to fold along the only vertical line. The resulting grid contains only 1.\nExample case 2: There is no sequence of moves which would result in a 1\xc3\x971 grid containing only 1.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/XORFOLD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 2D Arrays, ad-hoc, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1796\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-06-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
