b'\n\xc2\xa0\nWatson, from one of his programmer friends, finds out about the site codechef. Fascinated by the questions, he decides to make a question himself. He defines a pair of numbers (x,y) a perfect pair if at least one of the numbers is greater than a given number K. Now he wants to find out that given an array A (1-based index) of size N, and an operation (defined below) what should be the minimum number of operations required to make every possible pair in the array perfect.\nThe only operation which can be done on the array is as follows:\nSelect two distinct indices i, j (1 <= i <= N and 1 <= j <= N) and replace one of A[i] or A[j] with A[i]*A[j].\nNow he challenged Sherlock to solve this problem. As Sherlock is busy with his cases, help him to find the answer.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\nFirst line contains no of test cases T.\nEach test case has 2 lines. First line has two integers N and K seperated by space. Second line has N numbers seperated by space, where ith integer is A[i].\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print in a single line, the minimum number of operations required for that case. If it is not possible to make every pair in an array perfect then output -1.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 A[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 10^9\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 10^9\nSum of N across all the test cases in a test file does not exceed 10^6\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n\n2\n5 25\n4 3 2 1 5\n5 25\n0 0 3 4 5\n\n\nOutput:\n\n5\n-1\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\niiti_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/IITI14\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, dbyz2014, easy, iiti_adm\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-01-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
