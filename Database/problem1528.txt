b"\n\xc2\xa0\nMr. Swegwan likes to play around with arrays. Recently while sitting in his room he invented a new game to play with arrays. In this game, firstly you are given an array A of size N by Mr. Swegwan and each element of the array lies in the range [L,R](inclusive). You have to choose exactly one integer from the array and replace it with another integer that also lies in the range [L,R] inclusive. You necessarily have to change a number and you can't change a number with itself.\nAfter the replacement you are required to sort the array. Now Mr. Swegwan wants to know what would be the minimum integer that could occur at each position after the replacement and sorting.\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nFirst line of input contains T, the number of test cases.\nIn the description of each test case, the first line contains three space seperated integers N,L,R.\nThe second line for each test case contains N space separated integers, the array elements.\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nFor each test case output in a new line, N integers each showing the minimum element at the index on which it is being printed, if the answer exists and -1 otherwise.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 L \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 109\nL \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 R\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n2\n4 1 4\n1 2 3 4\n6 2 6\n2 3 4 2 3 4\n\nOutput:\n1 1 2 3\n2 2 2 3 3 4\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85daga_07\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SWEGARR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, cobl2016, daga_07, easy, sorting, swegwan\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-03-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
