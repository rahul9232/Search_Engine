b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese\n, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nProfessor GukiZ decided to distribute all of his candies to his NN students (numbered 11 through NN). Let's denote the number of candies GukiZ gave to the i-th student by pi. As GukiZ has a lot of students, he does not remember all the exact numbers of candies he gave to the students. He only remembers the following properties of the sequence p:\n\nThe numbers of candies given to each of the first K students (p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pK) are known exactly.\nAll elements of the sequence p are distinct.\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum element of the sequence p does not exceed x.\nThe professor gave out the biggest possible total number of candies, i.e. S=p1+p2+p3+\xe2\x80\xa6+pN is maximum possible.\n\nNormally, professors never lie, so the information provided by GukiZ is valid and there is at least one sequence that satisfies all conditions. GukiZ would like to know the total number of candies S he had at the beginning. Can you help him find this number?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, K and x.\nThe second line contains K space-separated integers p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pK.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of candies GukiZ had.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(N,2\xe2\x8b\x85104) \n0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthere is at least one valid distribution of candies to students\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4 3 4 \n2 1 5\n2 2 9\n3 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n12\n9\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There are four students. We know that the first student got p1=2 candies, the second student got p2=1 and the third got p3=5 candies; we don't know the number of candies given to the last student. The difference between the maximum and minimum number of candies given to students is already 5\xe2\x88\x921=4=x, so the fourth student could only have been given between 1 and 5 candies. It can't be 5 either, so we maximize the number of candies if we give 4 candies to the fourth student. In total, there are 2+1+5+4=12 candies.\nExample case 2: We know the number of candies given to each of the two students, so we know that GukiZ had 3+6=9 candies.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85allllekssssa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GUZAC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2065\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-08-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
