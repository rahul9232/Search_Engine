b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThis is an interactive problem.\nChef wants to decorate his kitchen with tiles. However, he is running out of money and needs to get the work done at a discount. The Slash Decorators are very proud of their skills and give an offer to Chef.\nThe kitchen is a square grid with length NN units and width NN units. It is divided into NN rows and NN columns. The rows are numbered 11 through NN from top to bottom. Similarly, the columns are numbered 11 through NN from left to right. Let's denote a cell in the ii-th row and jj-th column by (i,j)(i,j). The Slash Decorators want to use N2N2 colourful tiles with dimensions 1\xc3\x9711\xc3\x971 to cover the whole kitchen. The tiles can be placed in two orientations as shown in the figure below.\n\nNote that each of these two orientations can be converted to the other by rotating it 90\xe2\x88\x9890\xe2\x88\x98 clockwise.\nThe Slash Decorators initially filled all the cells of the kitchen with tiles, where each tile is placed in one of the two possible orientations. Chef does not know this initial configuration and his task is to find it by asking up to QQ queries. In each query:\n\nChef chooses a cell in the grid.\nThe Slash Decorators rotate the tile in the cell 90\xe2\x88\x9890\xe2\x88\x98 clockwise.\nThen, the Slash Decorators find all squares with area 22 formed by the blue diagonal lines (shown in the figure below) and tell Chef the number of these squares.\n\n\nIn addition, the Slash Decorators initially tell Chef the number of squares with area 22 formed by the blue diagonal lines in the initial configuration. Let's denote this number by KK.\nFor example, in the configuration shown below, there are 33 squares with area 22.\n\nThe queries are not independent, i.e. a tile rotated in a query stays rotated in subsequent queries. Chef may choose the same tile in multiple queries; in such a case, this tile is rotated multiple times.\nThe offer is that if Chef guesses the initial configuration correctly, the work will be done for free. Please help him. You play as Chef and the grader plays as the Slash Decorators. You should find the configuration the kitchen is in (the orientations of all tiles) when you finish asking queries; note that this is equivalent to finding the initial configuration.\nInteraction\n\nFirst, you should read a line containing a single integer TT \xe2\x80\x95 the number of test cases. The description of interaction for TT test cases follows.\nFor each test case, you should start by reading a line containing three space-separated integers NN, QQ and KK.\nThen, you may ask queries. For each query:\nPrint a line containing three space-separated integers 11, XX and YY.\nThe grader rotates the tile in the cell (X,Y)(X,Y).\nThen, read a line containing a single integer ZZ. If you ask an invalid query or more than QQ queries, Z=\xe2\x88\x921Z=\xe2\x88\x921. Otherwise, ZZ denotes the number of squares with area 22 formed by the blue diagonal lines.\nOnce you know the current configuration:\nPrint a line containing a single integer 22.\nThen, for each ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), print a line containing NN space-separated integers; for each valid jj, the jj-th of these integers should be 00 or 11 if the cell (i,j)(i,j) currently contains a tile in the first orientation or the second orientation, respectively, shown in the first figure.\nFinally, you should read a line containing a single integer. If your guess was incorrect, this integer is \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921. Otherwise, this integer is 11 and you should continue solving the remaining test cases.\n\nIf you receive \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921, you should terminate your program immediately to receive the Wrong Answer verdict. Otherwise, you may receive any verdict. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200\nthe sum of QQ over all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (1 point):\n\nN\xe2\x88\x88{2,4}N\xe2\x88\x88{2,4}\nQ=2N2Q=2N2\n\nSubtask #2 (11 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa4100N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nQ=12\xe2\x8b\x85N2Q=12\xe2\x8b\x85N2\n\nSubtask #3 (22 points): Q=5\xe2\x8b\x85N2Q=5\xe2\x8b\x85N2\nSubtask #4 (66 points): Q=4\xe2\x8b\x85N2Q=4\xe2\x8b\x85N2\nExample\nYou     Grader\n        2\n        2 16 0\n1 2 2\n        0\n1 1 2\n        1\n1 1 1\n        0\n2\n1 1\n1 0\n        1\n        4 64 3\n1 2 2\n        1\n1 3 2\n        0\n1 2 1\n        0\n1 3 1\n        1\n1 1 3\n        1\n1 1 4\n        1\n1 2 4\n        2\n1 4 3\n        2\n1 3 4\n        2\n1 4 4\n        3\n2\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n        1\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n \nExample case 2: The initial configuration is depicted in the problem statement.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85jay_1048576\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TILESQRS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Interactive Problems, Bitmasking, Gray code, ad-hoc, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Mathematics, Bit Manipulation, Number System, Binary, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2503\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
