b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese\n, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nMaybe Fulu is not so good at writing codes for median elements, but solving problems with queries is really easy for him. Today, he decided to give you one hard problem with queries from his national contest.\nYou are given two sequences A and B, each with length N (1-indexed), and Q queries. There are four types of queries:\n\n1lr \xe2\x80\x94 find max(Al,Al+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ar)\n2lr \xe2\x80\x94 increase Al,Al+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ar by Bl,Bl+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Br, i.e. for each i (l\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4r), change Ai to Ai+Bi\n3lrx \xe2\x80\x94 for each l\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4r, increase Bi by x\n4lrx \xe2\x80\x94 for each l\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4r, increase Ai by x\n\nCan you quickly process the queries?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and Q.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN denoting the initial sequence A.\nThe third line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN denoting the initial sequence B.\nThe following Q lines describe queries. Each of these lines starts with an integer t denoting the type of the query. If 1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa42, it is followed by a space and two space-separated integers l and r. If 3\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa44, it is followed by a space and three space-separated integers l, r and x.\n\nOutput\nFor each query of the first type, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum element in the subsequence Al..r.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n|Ai|\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n|Bi|\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n|x|\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3 6\n1 4 2\n3 1 2\n1 1 3\n2 1 3\n3 1 1 -2\n2 1 3\n4 1 2 3\n1 1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n9\n\n\nExplanation\nInitially, A=[1,4,2] and B=[3,1,2].\n\nIn the first query, we should find the maximum element of A, which is 4.\nAfter the second query, A=[4,5,4].\nAfter the third query, B=[1,1,2].\nAfter the fourth query, A=[5,6,6].\nAfter the fifth query, A=[8,9,6].\nIn the sixth query, we should find the maximum of A1 and A2, which is 9.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85allllekssssa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/NQNF\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Square Root Decomposition, Convex Hull, Range Queries, Online Queries\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Computational Geometry, Polygons, Algorithms, Queries\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3420\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-08-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
