b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\n        You are given an array that consists of n integer numbers. You have to change at most K elements of this array, so that the resulting array will be a arithmetic progression. From all the possible arithmetic progressions, you should choose most beautiful. \nYou can uniquely define the arithmetic progression by two numbers a0 and d - the first element of the given progression and the step that defines next element. (ai = a0+i * d). The progression A(a0 , d0) is more beautiful than the progression B(b0, d1) iff (a0 < b0 or (a0 = b0 and d0 < d1)) \nInput\n  The first line contains two integers N and K denoting the number of elements in the given array and the number of elements that you can change\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the given array.\nOutput\nOutput a single line containing the resulting array with at most K changes. Mind that among all the arithmetic sequences you have to choose the most beautiful.\n\nIn the given test data, it is always possible to recover at least one arithmetic progression under the constraints of the problem.\nConstraints\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 min(10, N-2)\n-109 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4 2\n1 2 1 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n-5 -2 1 4 \n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nfurko_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/UASEQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Loops, Conditional Statements, Basic Maths, AP, ad-hoc, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Basic Programming Concepts, Mathematics, Sequences and Progression, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1922\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-06-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
