b"\nChef has a sequence of NN integers A=[A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN]A=[A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN]. He can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero):\n\nChoose any positive integer KK and insert it at any position of the sequence (possibly the beginning or end of the sequence, or in between any two elements).\n\nFor example, if A=[5,3,4]A=[5,3,4] and Chef selects K=2K=2, then after the operation he can obtain one of the sequences [2\xe2\x80\x93,5,3,4],[5,2\xe2\x80\x93,3,4],[5,3,2\xe2\x80\x93,4][2_,5,3,4],[5,2_,3,4],[5,3,2_,4], or [5,3,4,2\xe2\x80\x93][5,3,4,2_].\nChef wants this sequence to satisfy the following condition: for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa31\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa3, Ai\xe2\x89\xa0iAi\xe2\x89\xa0i. Here, \xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa3 denotes the length of AA.\nHelp Chef to find the minimum number of operations that he has to perform to achieve this goal. It can be proved that under the constraints of the problem, it's always possible to achieve this goal in a finite number of operations.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of operations that Chef has to perform to achieve the given condition.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of NN over all test caes does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): Original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n2 4 5\n3\n4 1 3\n4\n3 2 4 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: The given sequence does not contain any index ii such that Ai=iAi=i. Hence Chef does not have to perform any operation.\nTest case 22: In the given sequence, A3=3A3=3. Chef can choose K=2K=2 and insert it before the first element, making the sequence A=[2\xe2\x80\x93,4,1,3]A=[2_,4,1,3], which does not contain any index ii for which Ai=iAi=i.\nTest case 33: In the given sequence, A2=2A2=2. Chef can perform the following sequence of operations:\n\nChoose K=5K=5 and insert it before the first element. The sequence becomes A=[5\xe2\x80\x93,3,2,4,2]A=[5_,3,2,4,2], and now A4=4A4=4.\nChoose K=3K=3 and insert it between the third and fourth element. The sequence becomes  A=[5,3,2,3\xe2\x80\x93,4,2]A=[5,3,2,3_,4,2], which does not contain any index ii for which Ai=iAi=i.\n\nIt can be verified that there is no way to satisfy the given condition in less than two operations.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85soumyadeep_21\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/NOFIX\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, feb222, simple, soumyadeep_21\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1250\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-12-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
