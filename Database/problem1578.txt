b'\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nOnly xx hours are left for the March Long Challenge and Chef is only left with the last problem unsolved. However, he is sure that he cannot solve the problem in the remaining time. From experience, he figures out that he needs exactly HH hours to solve the problem. \nNow Chef finally decides to use his special power which he has gained through years of intense yoga. He can travel back in time when he concentrates. Specifically, his power allows him to travel to N different time zones, which are T1,T2,\xe2\x80\xa6,TN hours respectively behind his current time.\nFind out whether Chef can use one of the available time zones to solve the problem and submit it before the contest ends.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers N, H and x.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers T1,T2,\xe2\x80\xa6,TN.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing the string "YES" if Chef can solve the problem on time or "NO" if he cannot.\nYou may print each character of each string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x<H\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ti\xe2\x89\xa4100 for each valid i\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 5 3\n1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\nChef already has 3 hours left. He can go to the 2-nd time zone, which is 2 hours back in time. Then he has a total of 3+2=5 hours, which is sufficient to solve the problem.\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 6 3\n1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\nIf Chef goes to the 1-st time zone, he will have 3+1=4 hours, which is insufficient to solve the problem.\nIf he goes to the 2-nd time zone, he will have 3+2=5 hours, which is also insufficient to solve the problem.\nSince none of the time travel options can be used to gain sufficient time to solve the problem, Chef is incapable of solving it.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/NOTIME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, Brute Force, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n932\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-03-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
