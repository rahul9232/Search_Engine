Initially, there are no roads between them. The Mayor of Chefland has ordered engineers to build roads across Chefland in such a way that each city is reachable from all other cities.\nFor each pair of distinct cities ii and jj, the cost of building a road between these cities is equal to (i\xe2\x88\xa7ji\xe2\x88\xa7j), where \xe2\x88\xa7\xe2\x88\xa7 denotes the bitwise AND operation. However, leaders of the cities have a weird condition \xe2\x80\x95 they only allow roads with positive costs to be built from their cities.\nHelp the Mayor find the minimum cost of building roads in the required way or determine that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NN. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum cost of building the roads or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41092\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n8\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We can connect city 11 with city 33 by a road with cost 11 and city 33 with city 22 by a road with cost 22.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85pandey__ji\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CROADS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bitwise Operation, Arithmetic, ad-hoc, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Bit Manipulation, Basic Maths, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2136\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-05-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
