Chef wants to test if he is really improving, so he asks Raja to solve the following problem.\nThe median of a sequence of numbers is computed in the following way:\n\nsort the sequence in non-decreasing order\nif the number of elements of this sequence is odd, the median is its middle element\nif the number of elements is even, the median is the average (arithmetic mean) of its two middle elements\n\nFor example, the median of [1,3,2][1,3,2] is 22 and the median of [2,3,3,2][2,3,3,2] is (2+3)/2=5/2.\nYou are given a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. Let's call a subsequence Ai1,Ai2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Aik (for any k>0, 1\xe2\x89\xa4i1<i2<\xe2\x80\xa6<ik\xe2\x89\xa4N) good if the median of this subsequence is an element of this subsequence. Find the number of good subsequences. Since this number may be large, compute it modulo 1000000007 (109+7).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of good subsequences modulo 109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa430\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa42N for each valid i\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (5 points): A is a permutation of integers 1 through N\nSubtask #2 (25 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask #3 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n2 3 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The good subsequences are [2], [3], [2], [2,2], [2,3,2].\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85teja349\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GMEDIAN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Combinatorics\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2116\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-10-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
