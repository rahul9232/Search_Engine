b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a recipe book. He wishes to read it completely as soon as possible so that he could try to cook the dishes mentioned in the book.\nThe pages of the book are numbered 11 through NN. Over a series of days, Chef wants to read each page. On each day, Chef can choose to read any set of pages such that there is no prime that divides the numbers of two or more of these pages, i.e. the numbers of pages he reads on the same day must be pairwise coprime. For example, Chef can read pages 11, 3 and 10 on one day, since (1,3), (3,10) and (1,10) are pairs of coprime integers; however, he cannot read pages 1, 3 and 6 on one day, as 3 and 6 are both divisible by 3. Since chef might get bored by reading the same recipe again and again, Chef will read every page exactly once.\nGiven N, determine the minimum number of days Chef needs to read the entire book and the pages Chef should read on each of these days.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nFirst, print a line containing a single integer D \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of days required to read the book. Let's number these days 1 through D.\nThen, print D lines describing the pages Chef should read. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines should contain an integer Ci followed by a space and Ci space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x95 the numbers of pages Chef should read on the i-th day.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions with the minimum number of days, you may print any one.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\nExample Input\n1\n5\n\nExample Output\n2\n3 1 2 5\n2 3 4\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nOn the first day, Chef should read three pages: 1, 2 and 5.\nOn the second day, Chef should read the remaining two pages: 3 and 4.\n\nThere are other valid solutions as well.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85noobie27\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/UNITGCD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Case work, Pigeonhole Principle, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Mathematics, Set Theory, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-03-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
