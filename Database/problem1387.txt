However, the gate is locked and it can only be opened with a secret code, which you need to obtain by solving the following puzzle:\nThere is a table in front of you, with NN coins placed in a row and numbered 11 through NN from left to right. For each coin, you know whether it is initially showing heads or tails. You have to perform exactly KK operations. In one operation, you should remove the rightmost coin present on the table, and if this coin was showing heads right before it was removed, then you should also flip all the remaining coins. (If a coin was showing heads, then after it is flipped, it is showing tails, and vice versa.)\nThe code needed to enter the temple is the number of coins which, after these KK operations are performed, have not been removed and are showing heads. Can you find this number? The fate of Persia lies in your hands\xe2\x80\xa6\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated characters. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these characters is 'H' if the ii-th coin is initially showing heads or 'T' if it is showing tails.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of coins that are showing heads after KK operations.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K<N\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4K<N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5 3\nH T T H T\n7 4\nH H T T T H H\n6 1\nT H T H T T\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin3\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/POPGATES\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, Observation, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1275\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-11-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
