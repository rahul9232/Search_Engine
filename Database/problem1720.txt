b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nThis problem has no story, so we at least wish you good luck solving it.\nConsider a multiset SS which contains AA copies of the integer 11, B copies of 2 and C copies of 3. For example, if A=3, B=3 and C=3, then S={1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3}.\nYour goal is to divide the elements of S into two groups (multisets); each element of S must be in exactly one of these groups and the sum of elements of one group must be equal to the sum of elements of the other group. In our example, it is possible to make the groups {1,1,2,2,3} and {1,2,3,3}; the sum of elements of each group is 9.\nDetermine if it is possible to make such groups.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers A, B and C. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to create two groups with equal sums or "NO" if it is impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4A,B,C\xe2\x89\xa41,000,000\nA+B+C\xe2\x89\xa51\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n3 3 3\n3 2 3\n1 1 2\n1 0 1\n1 1 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85mhammad1\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TWOGRS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Arithmetic, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Basic Maths, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2082\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-09-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
