He started testing the robot by letting it move on a line.\nInitially, the robot is placed at the coordinate x=Xx=X. Then, it should execute a sequence of NN commands, described by a string SS with length N. Each character of this string is either 'L' or 'R', denoting that the robot should walk one step to the left (decreasing x by 1) or to the right (increasing x by 1), respectively.\nHow many distinct points are visited by the robot when it has executed all the commands? A point p is visited by the robot if p is an integer and the robot's position before or after executing some command is x=p.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and X.\nThe second line contains a single string S with length N.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of points visited by the robot.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n|X|\xe2\x89\xa41,000,000\nS contains only characters 'L' and 'R'\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n6 10\nRRLLLL\n2 0\nLL\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The robot followed the path 10\xe2\x86\x9211\xe2\x86\x9212\xe2\x86\x9211\xe2\x86\x9210\xe2\x86\x929\xe2\x86\x928.\nExample case 2: The robot followed the path 0\xe2\x86\x92\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x86\x92\xe2\x88\x922.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TSTROBOT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Frequency Arrays, Sets, Maps, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1124\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-03-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
