b"\nPhineas goes to school after the lockdown is over and finds out that all his N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 friends have turned into bullies. So he himself too starts disliking his friends. The teacher Dr Doof wants to distribute MM marks to his NN students (including Phineas).  Dr Doof is busy in his experiments and so wants the students to distribute MM marks among themselves such that each student gets a non negative integer marks or gets expelled. So he makes a plan.\nHe makes all of his NN students stand in an line and then the NthNth student is made the leader.  The task of the leader is to propose the distribution of MM marks among all the students present. Then a voting is carried out and all present students ( including the leader) can vote either for or against the distribution.\n\nIf the distribution is voted for by at least 50%50% of the students present, then it is is approved with the leader becoming the deciding student and the process ends.\nOtherwise the last KK present students are expelled ( including the leader ). and the (N\xe2\x88\x92K)th(N\xe2\x88\x92K)th student is appointed as the new leader and the process is repeated.\n\nIf there are \xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4K students left and the distribution is not approved, then all the present students will get expelled.\nFollowing are the characteristics of each of the NN students and everyone knows about it.\n\nEveryone wants to maximize the marks they get or at least try not to get expelled (i.e. every student prefers getting 00 marks over getting expelled).\nEach of them have turned into bullies ( including Phineas ) and so given a choice of getting the \nsame marks and expel more students, then they would go for it.\nIf there are multiple distribution proposals maximizing the leader's marks that would be \naccepted (voted for by atleast 50%50% of the students) then he  will propose the \nlexicographically smallest such distribution.\n( As an example: If N=6,M=10N=6,M=10 and (0,0,4,1,0,5)(0,0,4,1,0,5), (0,3,0,0,2,5)(0,3,0,0,2,5) and (2,3,0,0,0,5)(2,3,0,0,0,5) \n  are the possible proposals that will be accepted, and 5 is the maximum marks \n  the leader can get, then he'll propose (0,0,4,1,0,5)(0,0,4,1,0,5))\nEach of them are brilliant logical thinkers.\n\nPhineas is confused and wants your help to know at what position he must stand so that he will be the deciding student if everyone thinks optimally and what maximum marks can he get being at that position.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, three integers N,M,KN,M,K, which are the total \nnumber of students NN, the total marks MM, and the number of students expelled in each round of failed voting KK.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line two space separated integers \xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x92 the position that Phineas should stand at to be the deciding student and the maximum marks he can get standing at that position. \nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSample Input:\n2\n4 1 2\n5 1 1\n\nSample Output:\n4 1\n4 0\n\nExplanation:\n\nFor the first test case the 4th4th student will be the leader initially and he needs at least 2 votes to approve his distribution. As K=2K=2, the 3rd3rd student will be expelled if the distribution is not approved and so he votes in favour of it. The 4th4th student will himself vote for it and so he will be the deciding student anyway. So he gives himself all the marks at stake , i.e, 1 mark.\nFor the second test case the 5th5th student will be expelled because he will not be able to gather at least 3 votes for any proposal. Then the (5\xe2\x88\x921)th(5\xe2\x88\x921)th student becomes the leader and distributes as follows:\n1st student-   0 marks\n2nd student-   0 marks\n3rd student-   1 marks\n4th student-   0 marks\nHe will get the vote from himself and the 3rd3rd student which is enough to approve his distribution.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85avijit_agarwal\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CLMARKS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, Patterns\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive, Observation\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3660\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
