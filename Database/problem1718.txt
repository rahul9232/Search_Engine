b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef is becoming bored with the recent lockdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak. To pass some time, he has started learning cryptography. He is very excited to see different types of keys used in cryptography and decided to invent a new type of a key.\nFirst, Chef made a sequence of integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN, which lie between 11 and M inclusive. After a lot of sleepless nights, he has decided that his key will be the LCM of this sequence, but he is not satisfied \xe2\x80\x95 he wants to make his key as large as possible. In order to do that, he wants to append exactly one more integer to the sequence. This integer must also lie between 1 and M inclusive.\nHelp Chef maximise the key. Find the integer which Chef should append to the sequence in order to make the key (the LCM of elements of the resulting sequence) as large as possible. If there are multiple solutions, choose the smallest among the integers to append which maximise the LCM.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest value of the new element which maximises the LCM.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4M for each valid i\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): N,M\xe2\x89\xa4102\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 2\n2 1 2\n4 7\n2 5 6 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n7\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85ezio_26\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MXMLCM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 LCM, Sieve of Eratosthenes\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-03-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
