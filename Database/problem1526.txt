b'\nWe all know how great ABD aka AB-DE-VILLIERS is. However his team mates were jealous of him and posed a problem for him to solve.The problem description is as follows :\n\nGiven an array of integers,find the length of the largest subarray(contiguous) of the given array with the maximum possible GCD (Greatest Common Divisor).\nFor info on GCD ,see this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor\n\nGCD of the subarray is defined as the GCD of all the elements of the subarray.\nAs ABD is not aware of competitive programming he asks your help. Help him!\n\nInput\nFirst line will contain integer N denoting the size of array.\n\nSecond line will contain N integers denoting array elements.\nOutput\nThe answer as specified in the problem statement .\nConstraints\n1 <= N <= 1000000\n\n1 <= array[i] <=100000000000\n\nExample\nInput:\n4\n2 4 8 3\n\nOutput:\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nGCD of all possible subarrays of the given array are : 2 , 2 , 2 , 1 , 4 , 4, 1 , 8 , 1 , 3\n\nLargest GCD possible : 8\n\nLength of the largest subarray with GCD as 8 is 1\n\nHence answer is 1 .\n\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85arpitdec5\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BYTES11\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, arpitdec5, bytes2016, simple\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-01-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
