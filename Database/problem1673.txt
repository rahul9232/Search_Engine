Unfortunately, all the operands were missing from this expression. Being an innovative person, Yukti immediately created a riddle for her students based on this incomplete expression.\nThe students are given a string LL describing a valid Boolean expression, where each operand (value) is replaced by the character \'#\'. A valid expression is defined as one of the following:\n\nA single term \'#\'.\nA string in the format "([expression1][operator][expression2])", where [expression1] and [expression2] are valid expressions and [operator] is one of the characters \'&\', \'|\' and \'^\' (denoting bitwise AND, OR and XOR respectively).\n\nEach of the characters \'#\' in the string LL should be replaced by one of the characters \'0\', \'1\', \'a\' and \'A\', uniformly randomly and independently. Then, the resulting expression is evaluated as follows:\n\nA Boolean value aa (0 or 1) is chosen. Each occurrence of the character \'a\' is interpreted as this value and each occurrence of \'A\' is interpreted as its negation (1\xe2\x88\x92a). The characters \'0\' and \'1\' are interpreted as the Boolean values 0 and 1 respectively.\nSince there are two possible values of a, we obtain two constant Boolean expressions this way. Let\'s denote them by G0 (when a = 0) and G1 (when a = 1). \nLet\'s evaluate G0 and G1.\nIf G0=G1=0, the value of the expression is \'0\'.\nIf G0=G1=1, the value of the expression is \'1\'.\nIf G0=0 and G1=1, the value of the expression is \'a\'.\nIf G0=1 and G1=0, the value of the expression is \'A\'.\n\nCan you find the probabilities with which the expression obtained after substituting for each character \'#\' evaluates to these values? It can be proved that for each of these values, the probability can be expressed as a fraction PQ, where P and Q are integers (P\xe2\x89\xa50, Q>0) and Q is coprime with 998,244,353. You should compute P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353 for each of these values.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string L.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing four space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x95 the answers corresponding to the probabilities that the value of the Boolean expression is \'0\', \'1\', \'a\' or \'A\' respectively.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4600\n1\xe2\x89\xa4|L|\xe2\x89\xa4100,000\nL contains only characters \'#\', \'(\', \')\', \'&\', \'|\' and \'^\'\nthe sum of |L| over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): |L|\xe2\x89\xa4300\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n#\n(#&#)\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n748683265 748683265 748683265 748683265\n436731905 935854081 811073537 811073537\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The probabilities that the value of the expression is \'0\', \'1\', \'a\' or \'A\' are all equal to 1/4.\nExample case 2: There can be total 16 different expressions.
