b"\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nThere is a communication channel with N+1N+1 stations (numbered 00 through NN). Station 0 wants to send a message to station N. You may install memory disks at up to K of the stations 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N\xe2\x88\x921. Let's denote the increasing sequence of stations at which memory disks are installed by (v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vk), where k\xe2\x89\xa4K is the number of such stations, and let v0=0 and vk+1=N. In stations other than v0,v1,\xe2\x80\xa6,vk+1, it is only possible to send the message forward without storing it for later.\nFor each i (0\xe2\x89\xa4i<N), if the message is currently at the station i, this station can send the message to the station i+1. This transfer takes one second regardless of its success or failure. With probability pi, the transfer succeeds and the message reaches the station i+1. Otherwise, the transfer fails and the message instantly goes back to the station vj, where j is the unique index such that vj\xe2\x89\xa4i<vj+1 (if i=vj, the message simply stays in the station vj), and this station has to send it forward again.\nYour task is to choose stations where memory disks should be installed, in such a way that the expected value of time needed for the message to reach station N is the smallest possible. Find this smallest expected time.\nYou are not given the probabilities directly. Instead, you are given a non-increasing integer sequence F0,F1,\xe2\x80\xa6,FN. For each valid i, pi=Fi+1/Fi.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.\nThe second line contains N+1 space-separated integers F0,F1,\xe2\x80\xa6,FN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one real number \xe2\x80\x94 the smallest possible expected time needed for the message to reach station N. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10\xe2\x88\x926.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(50,N\xe2\x88\x921)\n1012\xe2\x89\xa5F0\xe2\x89\xa5F1\xe2\x89\xa5\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x89\xa5FN\xe2\x89\xa51\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105\n\nExample Input\n1\n2 1\n4 2 1\n\nExample Output\n4.0000000000\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The probabilities of success are p0=p1=1/2. If no memory disks are installed, the expected amount of time the message needs to reach station 2 is 6 seconds.\nIf a memory disk is installed at station 1, the expected time is 4 seconds (2 seconds to transfer from station 0 to station 1 and further 2 seconds to transfer from station 1 to station 2).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85shaanknight\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COMMCHA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Expected Value, DP Approach, Divide and Conquer\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Probability, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Recursion\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2941\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-11-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
