Some subset of schools will be selected to compete, where the i-th school is selected with probability pi(mod998\xc2\xa0244\xc2\xa0353). The schools are all selected independently from each other. It's even possible that the number of selected schools will be 0 or 1, because the contest organizers are not very good mathematicians themselves.\nOnce the schools have been selected, each selected school must choose r of its students to form a team. The i-th school has ai students in total it can choose from. Given a selection of the schools, you are interested in the number of ways teams can be formed. Two ways are considered different if there is at least one school that chose different sets of students for its team.\nIf the subset of schools is chosen according to the above process, find the expected number of ways they can form teams.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer r.\nThe second line contains an integer k.\nThe third line contains k integers a1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ak.\nThe fourth line contains k integers p1,\xe2\x80\xa6,pk.\n\nOutput\nOutput the expected number of ways to form teams, modulo 998244353.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4pi<998\xc2\xa0244\xc2\xa0353\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1 (10 points): r\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask 2 (90 points): Original constraints.\nSample Input\n1\n2\n2 2\n1 1\n\nSample Output\n4\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85viv007\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85iscsi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MAT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Combinatorics, Expected Value, NTT\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Probability, Transformations\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3045\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-06-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
