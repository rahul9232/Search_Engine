He is really good at math and really likes solving engaging math problems. In the last exam, his professor gave him really hard math problems to solve, but Gorodetskiy could not solve them and failed the exam, so the professor told him: "These problems are a piece of cake, you should know them from school!" Here is one of the problems from the exam - you can decide if it really was an easy problem or not.\nYou are given a positive integer MM. Let\'s call a positive integer AA an interesting number if there is at least one integer B (A\xe2\x89\xa4B) such that A\xe2\x8b\x85B is divisible by M and A\xe2\x8b\x85BM=A+B.\nFind all interesting numbers. Let\'s denote the number of such integers by K; it is guaranteed that K\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x88\x97105.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer M.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nFirst, print a line containing a single integer K.\nThen, print K lines. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines should contain a single integer \xe2\x80\x95 the i-th interesting number in increasing order.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41014\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask #2 (20 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4107\nSubtask #3 (60 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4\n6\n5\n7\n8\n9\n10\n12\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There are two interesting numbers, 4 and 6.
