b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a secret recipe, represented by a set of N non-negative integers (note that these integers must be pairwise distinct). Under the current circumstances, he has decided to give it away so that people can try it out at home. \nHowever, Chef is so fond of guessing games that he set one condition: he wants you to guess the integers in the recipe. In order to do that, you may ask Chef at most K=5,000 queries. In each query, you choose a non-negative integer x and Chef's response to this query is the element in the set that has the smallest bitwise XOR with x (it can be proved that this element is unique).\nGuess the elements of the set correctly and let the world know Chef's secret recipe!\nInteraction\n\nFirst, you should read a line containing a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for T test cases follows.\nFor each test case, you should start by reading a line containing a single integer N.\nThen, you may ask queries.\nTo ask a query, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers 1 and x (0\xe2\x89\xa4x<260).\nThen, you must read a line containing a single integer \xe2\x80\x95 the answer to your query, or \xe2\x88\x921 if the query is invalid or if you have asked too many queries.\nFinally, you should print a single line containing the integer 2 followed by a space and N space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x95 the elements of the set in increasing order.\nThen, you must read a line containing a single integer: 1 if your answer was correct, or \xe2\x88\x921 if it was incorrect. If your answer was correct, you should continue solving the remaining test cases.\n\nNote that when you receive an answer \xe2\x88\x921, you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict.\nDon't forget to flush the output after printing each line!\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa485\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai<260 for each valid i\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): Ai<214 for each valid i\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\nExample\nYou                 Grader\n                        1\n                        4\n1 2\n                        2\n1 3\n                        3\n1 7\n                        7\n1 11\n                        10\n2 2 3 7 10\n                        1\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Chef's set is {2,3,7,10}. In the first 3 queries, three exact elements of the set are asked, so Chef's answers are these elements themselves. In the last query, the element of the set which has the smallest XOR with 11 is 10. On the last line, the elements of the set are printed in increasing order (with a leading 2).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85hasinfarhan\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SCRRCP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Interactive Problems, Bitwise Operation, Greedy, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Mathematics, Bit Manipulation, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-03-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
