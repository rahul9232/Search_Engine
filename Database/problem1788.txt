b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nYou are a warrior and you have to fight N enemy warriors (numbered 1 through N) one by one, in any order you choose. You have to win as many of these fights as possible.\nEach warrior has some amount of power, which changes when the warrior fights. For each i, the i-th enemy warrior has power Pi. When you have power x and you fight an enemy warrior with power y, the following happens:\n\nif x>y, you kill the enemy warrior and your power changes to 2(x\xe2\x88\x92y)\notherwise (if x\xe2\x89\xa4y), the enemy warrior kills you\n\nYou should answer Q queries. In each query, you are given your initial power X and you should find the maximum number of warriors you can kill if you are starting with power X.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN.\nQ lines follow. Each of these lines contains a single integer X describing a query.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of warriors you can kill.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 4\n1 2 1\n10\n2\n3\n1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n3\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85erfaniaa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/WARRIORS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Arbitrary Precision, Greedy, Sorting, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2803\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-08-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
