b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\n\nToday is chef\'s friend\'s birthday. He wants to give a gift to his friend. So he was desperately searching for some gift here and there. \n\n\nFortunately, he found an array a of size n lying around. The array contains positive integers. Chef\'s friend likes even numbers very much. So for the gift, chef will choose a  consecutive non-empty segment of the array. The segment should contain exactly k even integers. Though it can have any number of odd integers.\nHe will then pick that segment and gift it to his friend. \n\n\nBut there is a problem. It might not be always possible for the chef to choose such a segment. Please tell whether it is possible for chef to select some gift or not?\n\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of the input contains a single integer  T  denoting number of test cases. \nFor each test case, first line contains two space separated integers n, k. \nNext line contains n space separated integers denoting content of array a. \nIt is also guaranteed that all the numbers in the array a are distinct. \n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single line containing "YES" or "NO" (without quotes) corresponding to the situation.\n\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 a i  \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n Note \n\nA consecutive non empty segment of array a is a segment a[l], a[l + 1] , , a[r] such that 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 l \xe2\x89\xa4 r \xe2\x89\xa4 n. \n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2 1\n1 2\n3 2\n2 6 5\n3 3\n2 4 5\n4 2\n1 2 4 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\n\nFor  first  test case, we can select a[2, 2] = {2}. \nFor second  test case, we can select a[1, 2] = {2, 6}. \nFor third  test case, we can not select any consecutive segment having exactly 3 even numbers. \nFor fourth  test case, we can select a[2, 3] = {2, 4}. \n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85dpraveen\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PRGIFT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1420\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-07-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, PYPY\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
