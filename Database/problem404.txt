b"\nSagar came to a gym. Sagar is a lazy kind of person, So his trainer gave him a task to run on a new type of treadmill from the beginning to the end.\nThe treadmill is a looped belt with a total length of 2l2l meters, of which ll meters are located on the surface and are arranged in a straight line. The part of the belt which turns at any moment (the part which emerges from under the floor to the surface and returns from the surface under the floor) is assumed to be negligibly short.\nThe belt is moving uniformly at speed v1v1 meters per second. Sagar will be moving on it in the same direction at the constant speed of v2v2 meters per second, so his speed relatively to the floor will be v1v1\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89v2v2 meters per second. Sagar will neither stop nor change the speed or the direction of movement.\nThere are blocks of very small height stuck to the belt (nn blocks). They move together with the belt, and do not come off it. Sagar has to kickout the blocks, but he is more keen to move forward. So he will kick out all the blocks he will pass by, but nothing more. If a block is at the beginning of the belt at the moment when Sagar starts running, he will kick it out, and if a block is at the end of the belt at the moment when Sagar comes off the belt, he will leave it.\nYou are given the positions of the blocks relative to the initial start position of the belt 00\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89a1a1\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89a2a2\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89anan\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x892l2l. The positions on the belt from 00 to ll correspond to the top, and from ll to 2l2l \xe2\x80\x94 to the the bottom half of the belt (see example). All coordinates are given in meters.\n\nThe figure shows an example with two blocks. One is located in the position \n  a1a1\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89l\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x89dl\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x89d, and is now on the top half of the belt, the second one is in the position \n  a2a2\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892l\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x89d2l\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x89d, and is now on the bottom half of the belt.\nSagar begins to run along the belt at a random moment of time. This means that all possible positions of the belt at the moment he starts running are kickable. For each  ii  from 00 to nn calculate the probability that Sagar will kick out exactly ii blocks, also print the minimum of blocks with the lowest probability of kick-out and maximum blocks with highest probability of kick-out. \nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains space-separated integers nn, ll, v1v1 and v2v2 \xe2\x80\x94 the number of the blocks, the length of the treadmill's visible part, the treadmill's speed and Sagar's speed, respectively.\nThe second line contains a sequence of space-separated integers a1a1,\xe2\x80\x89a2a2,\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\xa6,\xe2\x80\x89anan (00\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89a1a1\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89a2a2\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89anan\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x892l2l) \xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of the blocks.\n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint nn\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x8911 numbers (one per line): the probabilities that Sagar kicks out exactly ii blocks, for each ii from 00 (the first line) to nn (the last line). The answer must be of exactly 99 decimal places.\nIn next line, print the minimum blocks with the lowest probability of kick-out and the maximum blocks with highest probability of kick-out. \n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4l,v1,v2\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4l,v1,v2\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 1 1 1\n0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0.750000000\n0.250000000\n1 0\n\n\nExplanation\nSagar can kick-out a block if by the moment he starts running its coordinate is less than 0.5; but if by \nthe moment the he starts running the block's coordinate is greater than or equal to 0.5, then he won't be \nable to kick it out. As all positions of the belt are kickable, the probability of kicking out the block \nequals 0.520.52=0.250.25, and the probability of not picking it up equals 1.521.52=0.750.75\nAs the highest probability is of 1 block & the lowest probability is of 0 blocks.\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 3 1 2\n2 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0.333333333\n0.666666667\n0.000000000\n2 1\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85abs_07\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LZLYF\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 abs_07, math, medium, probability, sorting, tcpc2021\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-11-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
