b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has been teaching probability and expectation in his class. He wants his NN students (numbered 11 through NN) to play a game so that they could understand the concepts clearly.\nFor each valid i, the i-th student should choose an integer from a range [Li,Ri] uniformly randomly. Chef wants to know the expected value of the ratio A/B, where A is the product of the integers chosen by the students and B is the GCD of these integers. Please help him calculate it.\nIt can be proved that this expected value can be expressed as a fraction PQ, where P and Q are positive integers and Q is coprime with 998,244,353. You should compute P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353, where Q\xe2\x88\x921 denotes the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 998,244,353.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nN lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Li and Ri.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x89\xa4Ri\xe2\x89\xa4105 for each valid i\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa4103\nRi\xe2\x89\xa4103 for each valid i\n\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n1 3\n2\n2 4\n5 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n15\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: There are three possible scenarios: student 1 can choose 1, 2 or 3. In all of them, A=B, so the expected value is 1.\nExample case 2: There are three possible scenarios:\n\nStudent 1 chooses 2, student 2 chooses 5: AB=2\xe2\x8b\x855gcd(2,5)=10.\nStudent 1 chooses 3, student 2 chooses 5: AB=3\xe2\x8b\x855gcd(3,5)=15.\nStudent 1 chooses 4, student 2 chooses 5: AB=4\xe2\x8b\x855gcd(4,5)=20.\n\nThe expected value of the ratio is 10+15+203=15.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85imanik\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RNDRATIO\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Integer Factorisation, Expected Value, Inclusion Exclusion Principle, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Probability, Set Theory, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-03-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
