b'\n\xc2\xa0\nVoldemort is back again! In order to kill him, Harry porter need to finish the final horcrux. The final horcux is he needs to draw a nested square of different lengths. He only can do the smaller length squares, but fails against the larger ones. Though he is a great magician, he is unable to solve this problem (he is not a programmer :p); he needs an expert to help him. As you are one of the best programmers in AUST, he asks you to solve the problem.\nYou will be given an integer  N (N will be odd length) , print the corresponding nested square to help Harry porter.\nInput\nFirst line there will an integer  T (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 20)  which represents number of test cases, next following T lines, there will an integer N (5 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100) .\nOutput\nFor each test case print the case number and then print the image of the square. For drawing the lines use character  (\xe2\x80\x98#\xe2\x80\x99) . See the sample I/O.\nExample\nInput:\n2\n5\n7\n\n\n\nOutput: \n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85shakilaust\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/AUPM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, aust2016, easy, shakilaust\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n15-01-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
