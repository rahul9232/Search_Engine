b'\n\xc2\xa0\nA Keyboard manufacturing company, built some faulty qwerty keyboards. As soon as they realized that some of the keyboards are faulty they tried to develop a software to correct them but their developers are noobs so they ask you to develop the software for them.\nThe issue with the keyboard is that the key placement is not appropriate. The keys of the right hand are faulty. \n\xc2\xa0When the user press j it appears h.\n Similarly when you press h it appears as ;(semi-colon), y \xe2\x86\x92 p, b \xe2\x86\x92 .(full stop).\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, total number of test cases. \nEach of the next T lines contain a sentence S(containing only lower-case english alphabets and valid characters as described) printed by the faulty keyboard.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case print the correct sentence the user wants to type in a new line.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n3\n;ekki wirkd\ncidec;ef\norigrannubg\n\n\nOutput:\nhello world\ncodechef\nprogramming\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nFor first test case ; replaces with h, k replaces with l, i replaces with o, the final output is hello world.\n\n\nN.
