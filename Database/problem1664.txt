He's so obsessed with this digit that he spends time thinking about it even during holidays.\nToday, Balsa invented an interesting problem: For a positive integer N, find the smallest integer greater than N such that its decimal representation contains the digit 3 at least three times.\nYou are given the integer N. Please solve this problem for Balsa.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the smallest number greater than N containing the digit 3 at least three times.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa440\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n221\n333\n3002\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n333\n1333\n3033\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85allllekssssa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BFTT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Modular Arithmetic, Basic Maths, Brute Force, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1572\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-08-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
