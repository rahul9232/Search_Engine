Type A contains only xa milliliters of coconut water and type B contains only xb grams of coconut pulp. Chef's nutritionist has advised him to consume Xa milliliters of coconut water and Xb grams of coconut pulp every week in the summer. Find the total number of coconuts (type A + type B) that Chef should buy each week to keep himself active in the hot weather.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nEach test case contains a single line of input, four integers xa, xb, Xa, Xb.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa415000\n100\xe2\x89\xa4xa\xe2\x89\xa4200\n400\xe2\x89\xa4xb\xe2\x89\xa4500\n1000\xe2\x89\xa4Xa\xe2\x89\xa41200\n1000\xe2\x89\xa4Xb\xe2\x89\xa41500\nxa divides Xa.\nxb divides Xb.\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n100 400 1000 1200\n100 450 1000 1350\n150 400 1200 1200\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n13\n13\n11\n\n\nExplanation\nTestCase 1: \nNumber of coconuts of Type A required = 1000100=10 and number of coconuts of Type B required = 1200400=3.  So the total number of coconuts required is 10+3=13.\nTestCase 2: \nNumber of coconuts of Type A required = 1000100=10 and number of coconuts of Type B required = 1350450=3.  So the total number of coconuts required is 10+3=13.\nTestCase 3: \nNumber of coconuts of Type A required = 1200150=8 and number of coconuts of Type B required = 1200400=3.  So the total number of coconuts required is 8+3=11.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85iscsi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COCONUT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Integer Division, Arithmetic\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Basic Maths\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n852\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-05-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
