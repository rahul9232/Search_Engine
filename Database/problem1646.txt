b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nDeep wants to become a 7-star coder on CodeChef. To achieve this goal, everyday, he has to solve as many problems as he can. But for the first time since he was new to programming, he wasn't able to solve a single problem and lost his confidence. Can you help him solve the problem so that he gets a new boost to go ahead?\nIn this problem, you are given a matrix that extends infinitely to the right and down, filled with values as shown below.\n\nLet (x,y)(x,y) denote the cell in the xx-th row and yy-th column. The upper-left cell (1,1) contains an integer 1. You begin at the cell (x1,y1) and must walk to the cell (x2,y2) by only moving right and down. Formally, from the cell (x,y), in one step you can move to the cell (x+1,y) or (x,y+1).\nThe value of a path is the sum of the values in all visited cells, including (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). You need to calculate the maximum possible value on the path of a path from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2).\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nEach test case contains of a single line of input, four integers x1, y1, x2, y2.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output in a single line the maximum possible value of a path from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x1\xe2\x89\xa4x2\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4y1\xe2\x89\xa4y2\xe2\x89\xa41000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n1 1 3 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\nExplanation\nThe only way to achieve the maximum possible value is by visiting cells with values 1\xe2\x86\x923\xe2\x86\x926\xe2\x86\x929\xe2\x86\x9213.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85deepraj99\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TLAPM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Constructive, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1788\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-04-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
