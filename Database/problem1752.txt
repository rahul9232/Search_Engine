Therefore, Rami spent days thinking about a problem with only three numbers as the input. Finally, he thought up such a problem and ran happily to his grandfather, shouting:\nYou are given three integers NN, MM and K. Find the number of sequences A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN such that:\n\nFor each valid i, Ai is an integer in the range [0,M\xe2\x88\x921].\nLet's define N prefix sums of A as Si=\xe2\x88\x91ij=1Aj, where 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N. At least K of these prefix sums are divisible by M.\n\nLet's see if you can solve this simple problem! Rami knows that the answer could be really large, so you should compute it modulo 109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and K.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of valid sequences modulo 109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4109\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 2 2\n3 2 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n7\n\n\nExplanation\nFor N=3 and M=2, there are eight possible sequences satisfying the first condition: [0,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,1,0], [0,1,1], [1,0,0], [1,0,1], [1,1,0] and [1,1,1]. Their prefix sums are [0,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,1,1], [0,1,2], [1,1,1], [1,1,2], [1,2,2] and [1,2,3] respectively.\nAs we can see, there are:\n\none sequence with 0 prefix sums divisible by 2: [1,0,0]\nthree sequences with exactly 1 prefix sum divisible by 2: [0,1,0], [1,0,1], [1,1,1]\nthree sequences with 2 prefix sums divisible by 2: [0,0,1], [0,1,1], [1,1,0]\none sequence with 3 prefix sums divisible by 2: [0,0,0]\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85i_love_islam\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ANGGRA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Modulo Multiplicative Inverse, Combinatorics, Observation, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Modular Arithmetic, Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2294\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-09-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
