Help Chefu and tell him the number of matches needed to write the result.\nDigits are formed using matches in the following way:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers A and B.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of matches needed to write the result (A+B).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n123 234\n10101 1010\n4 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n13\n10\n7\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The result is 357. We need 5 matches to write the digit 3, 5 matches to write the digit 5 and 3 matches to write the digit 7.\nExample case 2: The result is 11111. We need 2 matches to write each digit 1, which is 2\xe2\x8b\x855=10 matches in total.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MATCHES\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Arrays, Conditional Statements\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Basic Programming Concepts\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n986\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-09-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
