They are planning to hijack the bank for DD days and print the money. The initial rate of printing the currency is PP dollars per day and they increase the production by QQ dollars after every interval of dd days. For example, after dd days the rate is P+QP+Q dollars per day, and after 2d2d days the rate is P+2QP+2Q dollars per day, and so on. Output the amount of money they will be able to print in the given period.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nEach test case contains a single line of input, four integers D,d,P,QD,d,P,Q. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4P,Q\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4P,Q\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (15 points): d\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa4100d\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask #2 (85 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 1 1 1\n3 2 1 1\n5 2 1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n4\n13\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 11: \n\nOn the first day, the rate of production is 11 dollar per day so 11 dollar is printed on the first day.  \nOn the second day, the rate of production is 1+1=21+1=2 dollars per day so 22 dollars are printed on the second day.\nThe total amount of money printed in 22 days is 1+2=3 dollars.\n\nTest Case 2: \n\nFor the first two days, the rate of production is 1 dollar per day so 1\xe2\x8b\x852=2 dollars are printed on the first two days.  \nOn the third day, the rate of production is 1+1=2 dollars per day so 2 dollars are printed on the third day.\nThe total amount of money printed in 3 days is 2+2=4 dollars.\n\nTest Case 3: \n\nFor the first two days, the rate of production is 1 dollar per day so 1\xe2\x8b\x852=2 dollars are printed on the first two days.  \nOn the next two days, the rate of production is 1+2=3 dollars per day so 3\xe2\x8b\x852=6 dollars are printed on the next two days.\nOn the last day, the rate of production is 3+2=5 dollars per day so 5 dollars are printed on the last day.\nThe total amount of money printed in 5 days is 2+6+5=13 dollars.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85iscsi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHFHEIST\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, AP\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Sequences and Progression\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1410\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-05-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
