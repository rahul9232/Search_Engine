Each card in this deck has an integer written on it. Currently, he is learning how to make the deck sorted in non-decreasing order (from top to bottom) of the numbers on the cards using at most one shuffle move.\nA shuffle move means taking an arbitrary number of cards from the top of the deck and putting them at the bottom of the deck in the same relative order.\nFor example, if we have a deck of cards with numbers (5,7,3,3,8,2)(5,7,3,3,8,2), it is allowed to take the top three cards (5,7,3)(5,7,3) and put them at the bottom; the result is (3,8,2,5,7,3)(3,8,2,5,7,3).\nYou are trying to convince Chef that sometimes, it is impossible to sort the deck in non-decreasing order using at most one shuffle move. That is why you need to write a program that determines if it is possible to sort a given deck or not.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N. \nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN denoting the cards in the deck from top to bottom.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to sort the deck or "NO" if it is impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points):\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 10,000\n\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints \nExample Input\n2\n5\n1 5 2 4 3\n5\n3 4 5 1 2\n\nExample Output\nNO\nYES\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CARDMGK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-10-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
