Node 1 is the root and each edge is either white or black. The shape of the tree is as follows:\n\nLet's number the levels of the tree 0 through D from top to bottom. Each node at an odd level is connected to its parent with a white edge (e.g. edges 1\xe2\x88\x922 and 1\xe2\x88\x923), while each node at an even level is connected to its parent with a black edge (e.g. edges 2\xe2\x88\x924, 2\xe2\x88\x925, 3\xe2\x88\x926, 3\xe2\x88\x927).\nChef's friend Alice wants to pick two distinct nodes u and v and a colour C (white or black) uniformly randomly and add an edge between the nodes u and v with colour C. It is allowed for two parallel edges to exist between nodes u and v after this operation.\nA strip is an alternating cycle of white and black edges. Each vertex may appear any number of times in a strip. Find the probability that a strip is created when Alice adds an edge to the graph. It can be proved that this probability can be expressed as a fraction PQ, where P and Q are positive integers and Q is coprime with 1,000,000,007. You should compute P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 1,000,000,007, where Q\xe2\x88\x921 denotes the multiplicative inverse of Q modulo 1,000,000,007.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer D.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 1,000,000,007 (109+7).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): D\xe2\x89\xa415\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n333333336\n142857144\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Alice picks one of the following pairs (u,v): (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,1), (3,1) and (3,2). She also picks a colour, but a strip can be created only if Alice picks the colour black and one of the pairs (1,2), (2,1), (1,3) or (3,1), so the probability is 4/12=1/3, which is 333,333,336 modulo 1,000,000,007.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85phoenix71\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/STRPTRE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Permutations & Combinations, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Combinatorics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-03-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
