b"\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a rectangular piece of paper. He puts it on a big board in such a way that two sides of the paper are horizontal and two are vertical, and then he performs a sequence of N operations. You are given a string S with length N; for each valid i, the i-th character of S determines the type of the i-th operation:\n\n'R': Pick up the paper from the right side and fold it onto the left side.\n'L': Pick up the paper from the left side and fold it onto the right side.\n'U': Pick up the paper from the upper side and fold it onto the bottom side.\n'D': Pick up the paper from the bottom side and fold it onto the upper side.\n\nThe paper is folded in such a way that there is still a flat rectangular sheet of paper lying on the table after each operation, but it consists of multiple layers of the original sheet. The lengths of the horizontal and vertical sides of the resulting sheet (after performing these N operations) are W and H respectively. Let's build an Euclidean coordinate system on the paper, where the point (0,0) corresponds to the bottom left corner and (W,H) to the upper right corner.\nChef then draws M points on this folded sheet of paper. The ink used to draw them soaks deep into the paper, so each point is drawn on all layers of the paper (and also on both faces of each layer). \nFinally, Chef completely unfolds the paper. He's asking you to compute the distance between the nearest pair of points.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers N, M, W and H.\nThe second line contains a single string S.\nEach of the following M lines contains two space-separated integers X and Y denoting the coordinates of one point.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one real number \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum distance. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10\xe2\x88\x926.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n2\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n3\xe2\x89\xa4W,H\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4W\xe2\x88\x921\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Y\xe2\x89\xa4H\xe2\x88\x921\nthe points are pairwise distinct\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): all characters of S are 'U'\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\nExample Input\n2\n6 2 10 10\nULRDDL\n4 4\n5 5\n4 2 10 10\nRUDL\n1 1\n9 9\n\nExample Output\n1.41421356237\n2.00000000000\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PAPER\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Cartesian Coordinate System, Geometry, ad-hoc, Observation, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2516\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-01-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
