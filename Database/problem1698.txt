Since Snackdown is a contest of teams with up to two members, everyone is looking for a teammate. There are NN contestants (numbered 11 through N) who want to participate in Snackdown; let's denote the skill level of the i-th contestant by Si. These people want to pair up in N/2 teams; each team should consist of two people.\nClearly everyone wishes for their teammate to be as skilled as possible, so everyone wants to maximize their teammate's skill level. We call a pairing (an unordered N/2-tuple of teams) valid if there are no two teams consisting of people (A,B) and (C,D) such that SD>SB and SA>SC \xe2\x80\x94 in that case, A and D would both prefer to be on the same team rather than with their current teammates.\nFind the number of valid pairings. Since this number can be large, compute it modulo 1,000,000,007.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of valid pairings modulo 1,000,000,007.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nN is even\nthe sum of N for all test cases does not exceed 106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid i\n\nExample Input\n2\n4\n1 7 3 8\n4\n2 3 2 2\n\nExample Output\n1\n3\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The only valid pairing is for contestant 2 to be paired with contestant 4 (so contestants 1 and 3 form the other team).\nExample case 2: Since person 2 has the highest skill level and all others have the same skill levels, person 2 can choose anyone among the other three as a teammate. The remaining two people also form a team, so the number of pairings is 3.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TEAMMATE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Frequency Arrays, Maps, Permutations & Combinations, Partitions, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Mathematics, Combinatorics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-10-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
