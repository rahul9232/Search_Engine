b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n \nYou are given three integers A, B and C. You may perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times: choose one of the numbers A, B, C and either add 1 to it or subtract 1 from it.\nFind the minimum number of operations required to make the sequence A, B, C an arithmetic progression, i.e. a sequence which satisfies B - A = C - B.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers A, B and C.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum required number of operations.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10,000\n-109 \xe2\x89\xa4 A, B, C \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (35 points): -102 \xe2\x89\xa4 A, B, C \xe2\x89\xa4 102\n\n\nSubtask #2 (65 points): original constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n-5 0 5\n-5 7 6\n-10 -100 20\n1 -1 1\n51 23 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n7\n105\n2\n8\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: No operations are needed because 0-(-5) = 5-0.\nExample case 2: We can obtain an arithmetic progression in seven operations by adding 1 to A = -5 and subtracting 1 six times from B = 7.\nExample case 3: We should add 1 to B 105 times.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85lg5293\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/AFK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, AP\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Sequences and Progression\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-03-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
