b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nChef has a pepperoni pizza in the shape of a N\xc3\x97NN\xc3\x97N grid; both its rows and columns are numbered 11 through N. Some cells of this grid have pepperoni on them, while some do not. Chef wants to cut the pizza vertically in half and give the two halves to two of his friends. Formally, one friend should get everything in the columns 1 through N/2 and the other friend should get everything in the columns N/2+1 through N.\nBefore doing that, if Chef wants to, he may choose one row of the grid and reverse it, i.e. swap the contents of the cells in the i-th and N+1\xe2\x88\x92i-th column in this row for each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N/2).\nAfter the pizza is cut, let\'s denote the number of cells containing pepperonis in one half by p1 and their number in the other half by p2. Chef wants to minimise their absolute difference. What is the minimum value of |p1\xe2\x88\x92p2|?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nN lines follow. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the i-th of these lines contains a string with length N describing the i-th row of the grid; this string contains only characters \'1\' (denoting a cell with pepperonis) and \'0\' (denoting a cell without pepperonis).\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum absolute difference between the number of cells with pepperonis in the half-pizzas given to Chef\'s friends.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nN is even\nthe sum of N\xe2\x8b\x85N over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n6\n100000\n100000\n100000\n100000\n010010\n001100\n4\n0011\n1100\n1110\n0001\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Initially, |p1\xe2\x88\x92p2|=4, but if Chef reverses any one of the first four rows from "100000" to "000001", |p1\xe2\x88\x92p2| becomes 2.\nExample case 2: Initially, |p1\xe2\x88\x92p2|=0. We cannot make that smaller by reversing any row.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85erfaniaa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PEPPERON\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Brute Force\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1810\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-08-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
