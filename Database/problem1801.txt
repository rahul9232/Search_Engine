Chef needs to travel between cities in Treeland to work, but during the war, it is not safe.\nIn Treeland, there are NN cities (numbered 11 through N) and N\xe2\x88\x921 bidirectional roads connecting them in such a way that Chef can reach each city from any other city using these roads. Each road is occupied by a unique faction that assigned a positive integer code to it.\nLet f(A,B) denote the greatest positive integer which divides the code of each road on the shortest path between cities A and B (the GCD of these codes). If Chef wants to go from city A to city B safely, he needs to pay f(A,B) units of money.\nSince Chef is not sure between which pairs of cities he is going to travel, he wants to know\nS=N\xe2\x88\x91i=1N\xe2\x88\x91j=i+1f(i,j).\nHelp Chef calculate S.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains three space-separated integers X, Y and Z denoting that cities X and Y are connected by a road with code Z.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer S.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Z\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n1 2 4\n1 3 3\n2 4 1\n2 5 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nf(1,2)=GCD(4)=4\nf(1,3)=GCD(3)=3\nf(1,4)=GCD(4,1)=1\nf(1,5)=GCD(4,2)=2\nf(2,3)=GCD(4,3)=1\nf(2,4)=GCD(1)=1\nf(2,5)=GCD(2)=2\nf(3,4)=GCD(3,4,1)=1\nf(3,5)=GCD(3,4,2)=1\nf(4,5)=GCD(1,2)=1\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85ezio_26\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/WARTLND\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cook108, divisors, ezio_26, inclusion-exclusion, taran_1407, union-find\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2736\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-07-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
