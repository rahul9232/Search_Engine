A binary string contains only characters \'0\' and \'1\'. The bitwise XOR of two such strings XX and Y (denoted by X\xe2\x8a\x95Y) is also a binary string with length K.\nYou have a sequence A of binary strings, indexed from 1. Initially, it is empty.\nYou should process Q queries. In each query:\n\nYou are given two integers L and R (0\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R<2K). For each i (L\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4R), consider the string which is the binary representation of i, possibly padded with leading zeros so its length is exactly K; append this string to A. In total, you should append (R\xe2\x88\x92L+1) strings to A in this query.\nThen, compute the number of pairs (i,j) (1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4|A|) such that (Ai\xe2\x8a\x95Aj) is a palindrome. Since this number can be very large, compute it modulo 998,244,353.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers Q and K.\nEach of the next Q lines contains two space-separated integers L and R describing a query.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of pairs of strings in A such that their XOR is a palindrome, modulo 998,244,353.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa425,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa460\n0\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R<2K\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 25,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (5 points):\n\nK\xe2\x89\xa45\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 200\n\nSubtask #2 (10 points): L=R\nSubtask #3 (25 points):\n\nK\xe2\x89\xa450\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 50\n\nSubtask #4 (25 points):\n\nK\xe2\x89\xa420\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 5,000\n\nSubtask #5 (15 points):\n\nK\xe2\x89\xa440\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 5,000\n\nSubtask #6 (20 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2 3\n3 6\n2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n7\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The sequence A after the first query is ["011", "100", "101", "110"]. The valid pairs of indices are (1,2), (2,4) and (1,4).\nAfter the second query, the sequence A is ["011", "100", "101", "110", "010", "011"]. The valid pairs of indices are (1,2), (2,4), (1,4), (3,5), (1,6), (2,6) and (4,6).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85nishant403\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/XORPALIN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Frequency Arrays, Tries with XOR, Lazy Propagation, Coordinate Compression, Basic Maths, Bitmasking\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Advanced Data Structures, Tries, Advanced Tree Structures, Segment Trees, Advanced Algorithms, Pre processing, Mathematics, Bit Manipulation\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
