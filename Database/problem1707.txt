You are currently on tile 1. There is a signboard beside you, which says thus:\n\nStepping on tile i (for each valid i) activates a switch described by a binary string Si with length N. When you fell through the tunnels onto tile 1, switch S1 got activated.\nFor each valid i, when the switch Si gets activated, then for each j (1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4N), if the j-th character of Si is \'0\', tile j becomes unsafe to step on; otherwise (if the j-th character is \'1\'), tile j becomes safe to step on.\nStep on an unsafe tile and you shall testify the fate of all men \xe2\x80\x95 death!\nYou shall find that which you seek on reaching tile N. This tile must also be safe when you step on it.\n\nBeing a trained warrior, you are able to make jumps with length up to K tiles, in both directions. In other words, if you are currently at a tile i, you may jump to a tile j if j is a valid tile and |i\xe2\x88\x92j|\xe2\x89\xa4K.\nYou want to reach tile N as quickly as possible \xe2\x80\x95 you want to minimise the number of jumps you need to make. Find this minimum number of jumps.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.\nN lines follow. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the i-th of these lines contains a single string Si with length N.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of jumps you need to reach your target, or \xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4102\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K<N\xe2\x89\xa4103\nS1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SN contain only characters \'0\' and \'1\'\nfor each valid i, the i-th digit of Si is \'1\'\nthe sum of N2 over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points):\n\nT\xe2\x89\xa410\nN\xe2\x89\xa410\n\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5 2\n11001\n01010\n10101\n00110\n10101\n3 1\n110\n010\n011\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The optimal sequence of jumps is 1\xe2\x86\x922\xe2\x86\x924\xe2\x86\x923\xe2\x86\x925.
