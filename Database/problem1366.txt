b"\nRead problem statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian.\nChef opted for Bio-Statistics as an Open-Elective course in his university, but soon got bored, and decided to text his friends during lectures. The instructor caught Chef, and decided to punish him, by giving him a special assignment.\nThere are NN numbers in a list A=A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA=A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. Chef needs to find the mode of the frequencies of the numbers. If there are multiple modal values, report the smallest one. In other words, find the frequency of all the numbers, and then find the frequency which has the highest frequency. If multiple such frequencies exist, report the smallest (non-zero) one.\nMore formally, for every vv such that there exists at least one ii such that Ai=vAi=v, find the number of jj such that Aj=vAj=v, and call that the frequency of vv, denoted by freq(v)freq(v). Then find the value ww such that freq(v)=wfreq(v)=w for the most number of vvs considered in the previous step. If there are multiple values ww which satisfy this, output the smallest among them.\nAs you are one of Chef's friends, help him complete the assignment.\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains an integer TT, the number of test cases. \nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NN, the number of values in Chef's assignment.\nThe second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers, AiAi, denoting the values in Chef's assignment. \n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print the mode of the frequencies of the numbers, in a new line. \nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa410\n\nSubtasks\n\n30 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n70 points : Original constraints.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n8\n5 9 2 9 7 2 5 3\n9\n5 9 2 9 7 2 5 3 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n\n\nExplanation\n\nTest case 1: (2(2, 99 and 5)5) have frequency 22, while (3(3 and 7)7) have frequency 11. Three numbers have frequency 22, while 22 numbers have frequency 11. Thus, the mode of the frequencies is 22.\nTest case 2: (2(2, 99 and 5)5) have frequency 22, while (3(3, 11 and 7)7) have frequency 11. Three numbers have frequency 22, and 33 numbers have frequency 11. Since there are two modal values 11 and 22, we report the smaller one: 11.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nakash_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MODEFREQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Arrays, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1234\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-08-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
