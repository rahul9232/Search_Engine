For each valid i, there are ai raw meals stacked on top of each other in section i.\nChef Rami has a special cooking device. This device can take all the meals that are stacked in some section and instantly cook them. He may perform the following operations in any order any number of times (including zero), until all the meals are cooked:\n\nChoose a section and use the device to cook all the meals in that section. This move costs X units of energy regardless of which section it is applied to.\nChoose a section i (i\xe2\x89\xa52) and move all the meals that are located in section i on top of the meals in section i\xe2\x88\x921 (if there are 0 meals in section i\xe2\x88\x921, all the meals from section i are simply moved). The cost of this move is the number of meals located in section i before the move.\nChoose a section i (i<N) and move all the meals that are located in section i on top of the meals in section i+1. The cost of this move is also the number of meals located in section i before the move.\n\nSince Chef Rami is lazy, he wants to spend the minimum amount of energy to cook all the meals. Help him calculate this value.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and X.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of units of energy Chef Rami needs to spend.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 20,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 500\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 3\n5 2 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: One of the optimal solutions is to move all the meals from the second section to the third section, with cost 2, and then use the device on the first and third sections, with cost 3 units of energy per use. The total cost is 2+3+3=8 units of energy.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85joudzouzou\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFRAMI\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming, Two pointers\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2576\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-04-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
