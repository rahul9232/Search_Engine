b'\nThe Princess of the Indian Royal Rajput clan loves her Royal Palace. There are N rooms in the palace. Every room has one or more statues. It is not necessary that every room has the same number of statues.\nThe Princess believes in total equality. It makes her sad to see some rooms with more statues than other rooms. Hence, she has decided to make the number of statues equal in all the rooms. Fortunately, the total number of statues in the palace, across all the rooms, is a multiple of N.\nYour job is to figure out the minimum number of moves needed in order to equalize the number of statues in all the rooms. In one move, you may select a statue and move it to any other room. All the statues are indistinguishable.\nInput\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case is described on two lines.\nThe first line contains a single positive integer N, the number of rooms.\nThe second line contains N positive integers { A1, A2, ..., AN } separated by single spaces, describing the number of statues in each of the N rooms respectively.\nThe end of input is signified by a special test case with N = 0. This will be the last test case in the input, and should not be processed.\nConstraints\nThere are at most 50 test cases in a test file.\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nSum of all Ai\'s is divisible by N\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print two lines in the output. The first of such lines is the test case number, T in the form of "Set #T", without the quotes (see sample output for clarity). On the second line, print "The minimum number of moves is M.", without the quotes. Here, M is the minimum number of moves you must make to equalize the number of statues in all the rooms. Output a blank line after each test case.\nBe careful about the case and punctuation in the above strings. Not adhering to the output format strictly will lead to the Wrong Answer verdict.\nSample Input\n6\n5 2 4 1 7 5\n3\n2 3 4\n0\n\nSample Output\nSet #1\nThe minimum number of moves is 5.\n\nSet #2\nThe minimum number of moves is 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin\n\n\nTester:\n1\xe2\x98\x85gamabunta\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/STATUES\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 acmkan13, ad-hoc, admin\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-10-2013\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nJAVA, C, PYP3, GO\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
