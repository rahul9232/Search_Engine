b'\nRead problems statements Mandarin , Bengali , Hindi , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a grid with N rows and M columns; each cell of this grid is either empty or contains an obstacle. Initially, all cells are colorless.\nYou may perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (including zero): choose a 2\xc3\x972 square in the grid and color all four of its cells. Each cell may be colored any number of times.\nYou want all empty cells to be colored and all cells containing obstacles to be colorless. Find out if this state can be achieved.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M. \nThe following N lines describe the grid. Each of these lines contains a string with length M containing only characters \'.\' (denoting an empty cell) and \'#\' (denoting a cell with an obstacle).\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it possible to color the grid in the required way or "NO" if it is impossible (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4103\nthe sum of N\xe2\x8b\x85M over all test cases does not exceed 5,000,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): only the first row of the grid may contain obstacles\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 3\n..#\n...\n...\n3 3\n...\n.#.\n...\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CLORGIRD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Constructive\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1674\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-10-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
