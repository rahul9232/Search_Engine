b'\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChefland has 77 days in a week. Chef is very conscious about his work done during the week.\nThere are two ways he can spend his energy during the week. The first way is to do xx units of work every day and the second way is to do yy (>x) units of work for the first d (<7) days and to do z (<x) units of work thereafter since he will get tired of working more in the initial few days.\nFind the maximum amount of work he can do during the week if he is free to choose either of the two strategies.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains a single line of input, four integers d, x, y, z.\n\nOutput\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the answer to the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4d<7\n1\xe2\x89\xa4z<x<y\xe2\x89\xa418\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): Original constraints\nSample Input\n3\n1 2 3 1\n6 2 3 1\n1 2 8 1\n\nSample Output\n14\n19\n14\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: Using the first strategy, Chef does 2\xe2\x8b\x857=14 units of work and using the second strategy Chef does 3\xe2\x8b\x851+1\xe2\x8b\x856=9 units of work. So the maximum amount of work that Chef can do is max(14,9)=14 units by using the first strategy.\nTest Case 2: Using the first strategy, Chef does 2\xe2\x8b\x857=14 units of work and using the second strategy Chef does 3\xe2\x8b\x856+1\xe2\x8b\x851=19 units of work. So the maximum amount of work that Chef can do is max(14,19)=19 units by using the second strategy.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85stevens\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EITA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, Brute Force\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-06-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
