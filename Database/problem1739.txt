b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nYou are given two sets of segments on a line, AA and BB. Set AA contains N segments (numbered 1 through N); for each valid i, the i-th of these segments is SA,i=[LA,i,RA,i]. Set B contains M segments (numbered 1 through M); for each valid i, the i-th of these segments is SB,i=[LB,i,RB,i]. \nFind \xe2\x88\x91Ni=1\xe2\x88\x91Mj=1|SA,i\xe2\x88\xa9SB,j|, where |SA,i\xe2\x88\xa9SB,j| denotes the length of the intersection of the i-th segment from set A and the j-th segment from set B. Note that the length of a segment [l,r] is r\xe2\x88\x92l.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nN lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers LA,i and RA,i.\nM more lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers LB,i and RB,i.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the value of the sum.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4LA,i<RA,i\xe2\x89\xa4108 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4LB,i<RB,i\xe2\x89\xa4108 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of M over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nExample Input\n3\n2 2\n1 2\n3 4\n1 3\n2 4\n1 1\n1 2\n3 4\n2 1\n5 6\n6 8\n5 8\n\nExample Output\n2\n0\n3\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The intersection of SA,1 and SB,1 is the segment [1,2]. The intersection of SA,2 and SB,2 is [3,4]. Both remaining intersections have lengths 0, so the sum is 1+1=2.\nExample case 2: The only two segments have an empty intersection, which has length 0.\nExample case 3: The segment [5,8] is covered by both sets of segments, so the sum is 3.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TOVERLP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ccrc2021, coordinate-compression, daanish_adm, difference-array, easy-medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2631\n\n\nDate Added:\n6-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
