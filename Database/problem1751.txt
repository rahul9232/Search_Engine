b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nYou are given an axis-aligned rectangle in a 2D Cartesian plane. The bottom left corner of this rectangle has coordinates (0,0) and the top right corner has coordinates (N\xe2\x88\x921,N\xe2\x88\x921). You are also given K light sources; each light source is a point inside or on the perimeter of the rectangle.\nFor each light source, let\'s divide the plane into four quadrants by a horizontal and a vertical line passing through this light source. The light source can only illuminate one of these quadrants (including its border, i.e. the point containing the light source and two half-lines), but the quadrants illuminated by different light sources may be different.\nYou want to assign a quadrant to each light source in such a way that when they illuminate their respective quadrants, the entire rectangle (including its perimeter) is illuminated. Find out whether it is possible to assign quadrants to light sources in such a way.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers K and N.\nEach of the next K lines contains two space-separated integers x and y denoting a light source with coordinates (x,y).\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "yes" if it is possible to illuminate the whole rectangle or "no" if it is impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x921\nno two light sources coincide\n\nExample Input\n2\n2 10\n0 0\n1 0\n2 10\n1 2\n1 1\n\nExample Output\nyes\nno\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin2\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RECTLIT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 admin2, brute-force, easy-medium, geometry, inclusion-exclusion, snckel19, taran_1407\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-12-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
