b"\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a string A of length N, consisting of zeroes and ones. You want to partition it into blocks consisting of consecutive indices such that each block has an odd sum and has length at most m. For each m from 1 to N, find the minimum number of blocks required, or report that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines:\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string A=a1a2\xe2\x80\xa6aN. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print N space-separated integers. The m-th of these integers should be the minimum number of blocks of length at most m the array can be partitioned into, such that each block has an odd sum, or \xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to do so.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\nThe sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 106.\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (9 Points): The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 200.\nSubtask 2 (13 Points): The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 2500.\nSubtask 3 (21 Points): The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 15000.\nSubtask 4 (17 Points): The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 50000.\nSubtask 5 (24 Points): The sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 250000.\nSubtask 6 (16 Points): No additional constraints.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n01101\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n-1 3 3 3 1\n\n\nExplanation\nClearly if m=1, no such partitioning is possible, as the first block must consist of a single 0.\nFor m=2,3,4, we can partition it as 01101. Note that 01101 is also a valid partition.\nIf m=5, the partition consisting of a single block 01101 is valid as the total sum (3) is odd.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85um_nik\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PARTODD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Observation, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3426\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-05-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
