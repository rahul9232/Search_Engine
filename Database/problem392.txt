b'\n\n\nOur very own SS sir is teaching data structures to his students. He told the students that a full binary tree is a tree in which every node other than the leaves have two children. If one more edge is added to tree, it will definitely form a cycle.\nHe has given an assignment to the students :-\nHe has an infinite full binary tree.\nThe root is labelled as 1.\nFor a node labelled v its left child will be labelled 2*v and its right child will be labelled 2*v+1.\nNow he joins two nodes A and B. He wants to know the length of the cycle formed.\nThe students are in fix. Help them to find the length of the cycle formed.\nNOTE: The line joining A and B will not cross any other node.\nInput\nFirst line contains Q, the number of queries. Each query consists of two space separated integers A and B in one line.\nOutput\nFor each query, print the required answer in one line.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i , j \xe2\x89\xa4 1018\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n2 3\n2 7\n5 15\n\nOutput:\n3\n4\n6\n\nExplanation\nFor 1st query, the length of the cycle formed is 3 (2 -> 1 -> 3 ->2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85deathcoder007\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TREECON\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cost2016, deathcoder007, math, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-02-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, JS\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
