The cells of this grid contain integers 1 through N\xe2\x8b\x85N in some order. You do not know this order, but some information remains to this day: M pairs of cells with Manhattan distance 1 or 2.\nYou should find a grid satisfying the following conditions (or decide that it does not exist):\n\nThe cells of the grid contain all integers from 1 to N2.\nFor each given pair (u,v), the cells containing u and v have Manhattan distance 1 or 2.\nThere are no other pairs of cells with Manhattan distance 1 or 2.\n\nIf there are multiple possible solutions, you may find any one.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nEach of the following M lines contains two space-separated integers u and v describing a pair of cells at distance 1 or 2.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf there is no solution, print a single line containing the integer \xe2\x88\x921.\nOtherwise, print N lines containing N space-separated integers each. The j-th integer on the i-th line should denote the number in the i-th row and j-th column of the grid.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200\n0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N2\nu\xe2\x89\xa0v\nall pairs (u,v) are distinct\nthe sum of M over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nExample Input\n2\n2 6\n1 3\n1 4\n1 2\n3 4\n3 2\n4 2\n3 6\n3 8\n3 1\n3 9\n3 5\n3 2\n8 1\n\nExample Output\n1 3\n2 4\n-1\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Note that there are many possible solutions.\nExample case 2: A solution satisfying all constraints on given pairs may exist, but there would always be some other pair of cells with distance 1 or 2 too.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85bciobanu\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RECOVER\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Constructive\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-11-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
