b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a set SS and QQ queries. Initially, SS is empty. In each query:\n\nYou are given a positive integer XX.\nYou should insert XX into SS.\nFor each y\xe2\x88\x88Sy\xe2\x88\x88S before this query such that y\xe2\x89\xa0Xy\xe2\x89\xa0X, you should also insert y\xe2\x8a\x95Xy\xe2\x8a\x95X into SS (\xe2\x8a\x95\xe2\x8a\x95 denotes the XOR operation).\nThen, you should find two values EE and OO: the number of elements of SS with an even number of 11-s and with an odd number of 11-s in the binary representation, respectively.\n\nNote that a set cannot have duplicate elements, so if you try to insert into SS an element that is already present in SS, then nothing happens.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer QQ.\nEach of the next QQ lines contains a single integer XX describing a query.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing two space-separated integers EE and OO.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa451\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q,X\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4Q,X\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa41281\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4128\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n4\n2\n7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0 1\n1 2\n3 4\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nInitially, the set is empty: S={}S={}.\nAfter the first query, S={4}S={4}, so there is only one element with an odd number of 11-s in the binary representation ("100").\nAfter the second query, S={4,2,6}S={4,2,6}, there is one element with an even number of 11-s in the binary representation (66 is "110") and the other two elements have an odd number of 11-s.\nAfter the third query, S={4,2,6,7,3,5,1}S={4,2,6,7,3,5,1}.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85prnjl_rai\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PRTAGN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bit Manipulation, Constructive\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1831\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-05-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
