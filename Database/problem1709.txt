b'\nRead problems statements Bengali , Mandarin chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are NN cities on a circle, numbered 11 through N. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x921), cities i and i+1 are directly connected by a bidirectional road with length Ai, and cities N and 1 are also directly connected by a bidirectional road with length AN. However, we do not know the lengths of some roads.\nFor each city i, we do know that it has an opposite city \xe2\x80\x94 formally, there is a city j\xe2\x89\xa0i such that the clockwise distance between cities i and j is equal to the counterclockwise distance between these cities.\nPlease find the lengths of all roads in such a way that the above condition is satisfied and the sum of lengths of all roads is minimised.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. For each valid i, Ai=\xe2\x88\x921 denotes that the length of road i is unknown.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a line containing the string "NO" if there is no solution or "YES" otherwise. If a solution exists, print a second line containing N space-separated positive integers \xe2\x80\x94 the lengths of all roads in your solution. Each of these integers should be \xe2\x89\xa4109. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any one.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 or Ai=\xe2\x88\x921 for each valid i\nthe sum of N for all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa44\nSubtask #2 (20 points): Ai=\xc2\xb11 for each valid i\nSubtask #3 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n4\n1 1 1 1\n4\n1 1 1 2\n4\n1 -1 -1 4\n4\n1 -1 2 -1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n1 1 1 1\nNO\nYES\n1 4 1 4\nNO\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/OPPOSITE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, easy, kingofnumbers, ltime64, observation, proof, taran_1407\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1925\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-09-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
