b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are playing a Billiards-like game on an N\xc3\x97NN\xc3\x97N table, which has its four corners at the points {(0,0),(0,N),(N,0),{(0,0),(0,N),(N,0), and (N,N)}(N,N)}. You start from a coordinate (x,y)(x,y),  (0<x<N,0<y<N)(0<x<N,0<y<N) and shoot the ball at an angle 45\xe2\x88\x9845\xe2\x88\x98 with the horizontal. On hitting the sides, the ball continues to move with the same velocity and ensuring that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection with the normal, i.e, it is reflected with zero frictional loss. On hitting either of the four corners, the ball stops there and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t move any further. \nFind the coordinates of the point of collision, when the ball hits the sides for the KthKth time. If the ball stops before hitting the sides KK times, find the coordinates of the corner point where the ball stopped instead.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer TT, the number of testcases.\nEach testcase contains a single line of input, which has four space separated integers - NN, KK, xx, yy, denoting the size of the board, the number of collisions to report the answer for, and the starting coordinates.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, print the coordinates of the ball when it hits the sides for the KthKth time, or the coordinates of the corner point if it stopped earlier.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41092\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\n\n3030 points :  Sum of KK over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4107\xe2\x89\xa4107\n7070 points : Original constraints.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5 5 4 4\n5 2 3 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5 5\n3 5\n\n\nExplanation\n\nSample Case 11 : \n\nWe are given a 55 by 55 board. We shoot the ball from coordinates (4,4)(4,4), and we need to find its coordinates after it has collided with sides 55 times. However, after shooting, the ball goes directly to the corner (5,5)(5,5), and stops there. So we report the coordinates (5,5)(5,5).\n\n\nSample Case 22 : \n\nWe are given a 55 by 55 board. We shoot the ball from the coordinates (3,1)(3,1), and we need to find its coordinates after it has collided with the sides twice. After shooting, it first hits the right side at (5,3)(5,3), and then the top side at (3,5)(3,5). So, we report (3,5)(3,5).\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BILLRD\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Case work, Conditional Statements, Basic Maths, Cartesian Coordinate System, Geometry, ad-hoc, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Basic Programming Concepts, Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
