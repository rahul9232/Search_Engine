Chef would like you to feel his happiness and provide him with a solution for this new problem with a sequence of integers. The problem is as follows.\nYou are given a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. You need to determine if it is possible to choose two indices ii and j such that Ai\xe2\x89\xa0Aj, but AAi = AAj. (If it was possible, Chef would be truly happy.)\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "Truly Happy" if it is possible to choose required indices or "Poor Chef" otherwise.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (27 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nSubtask #2 (73 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n4\n1 1 2 3\n4\n2 1 3 3\n5\n5 4 4 3 1\n5\n3 2 1 1 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nTruly Happy\nPoor Chef\nPoor Chef\nTruly Happy\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Chef is truly happy because AA3=AA1 and A3\xe2\x89\xa0A1.\nExample case 2: There is no pair of indices which would make Chef truly happy. For instance, AA3=AA4, but A3=A4,\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHHAPPY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 data-structure, implementation, mgch, nov18, simple, taran_1407\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1594\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-11-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
