You are to help him in this work.\nToday Chef has cooked the brand new circular cake. To split the cake Chef can make several (possibly, zero) cuts. Each cut should be a straight line going from the center of the cake to its border. Also, the angle between any two cuts should have positive integer value (Chef measure all the angles in degrees). Chef consider two pieces of cake equal if the appropriate angles are equal.\nThe picture contains two distinct pieces, and two cuts. Red part on the image shows one piece. The appropriate angle is AOB.\nChef gives to you an integer N, denoting the number of pieces Chef wants to make. You need to answer the following questions:\n\nIs it possible to make exactly N equal pieces from the whole cake?\nIs it possible to make exactly N pieces from the whole cake?\nIs it possible to make exactly N pieces from the whole cake, in such a way that no two of them are equal?\nInput\nFirst line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contain a single integer N denoting the number of pieces Chef wants to make.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output one line containing 3 space separated characters.\nAbove, we defined the 3 questions that Chef will ask. Output 'y' for yes or 'n' for no (quotes for clarity) for each of those questions.\nAnswers for 3 questions (in the order above) must be space separated on the same line.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4\n7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\ny y y\nn y y\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.\nIs it possible to make N equal pieces?\nYes, you can cut 4 pieces each with 90 degrees angle.\nIs it possible to make N pieces?\nYes, you can cut 4 pieces each with 90 degrees angle.\nIs it possible to make N pieces, such that no two of them are equal?\nYes, you can cut 4 pieces with angles 88, 89, 91, 92.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85anudeep2011\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85gerald\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ANUDTC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Geometry\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1426\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-04-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
