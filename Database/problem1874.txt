It is possible to travel from each city to any other city using the roads. Moreover, each city is specialised in either black or white chocolate.\nChef wants to construct three new restaurants. However, he is still not sure where to build them. You should answer Q queries; in each query, Chef gives you two cities L and R and you should find the number of ways to choose a set of three distinct cities that satisfies the following conditions:\n\nThe chosen cities belong to the shortest path between the cities L and R (both inclusive).\nFor any two chosen cities (let's denote them by u and v; u\xe2\x89\xa0v), there is at least one city specialised in black chocolate on the shortest path between the cities u and v (both inclusive).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. For each valid i, Ai=1 if the i-th city is specialised in black chocolate or 0 if it is specialised in white chocolate.\nEach of the following N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers x and y denoting that cities x and y are connected by a road.\nThe next line contains a single integer Q.\nEach of the following Q lines contains two space-separated integers L and R describing a query.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of ways to choose three cities.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L,R\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n12\n1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 10\n5 1\n7 6\n6 12\n4 6\n1 6\n2 6\n11 1\n3 1\n1 9\n8 1\n9\n8 4\n2 9\n3 8\n6 12\n2 9\n1 9\n7 12\n1 5\n10 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4\n1\n0\n4\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85dalgerok\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BLWHTREE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, HLD, Combinatorics, Inclusion Exclusion Principle\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Mathematics, Set Theory\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2921\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-11-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
