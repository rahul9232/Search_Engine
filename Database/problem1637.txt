The canteen serves only three items (well, they serve more, but only these three are edible!), which are omelette, chocolate milkshake, and chocolate cake. Their prices are AA, BB and C respectively.\nHowever, the canteen is about to run out of some ingredients. In particular, they only have E eggs and H chocolate bars left. They need:\n\n2 eggs to make an omelette\n3 chocolate bars for a chocolate milkshake\n1 egg and 1 chocolate bar for a chocolate cake\n\nEach of the N friends wants to order one item. They can only place an order if the canteen has enough ingredients to prepare all the ordered items. Find the smallest possible total price they have to pay or determine that it is impossible to prepare N items.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains six space-separated integers N, E, H, A, B and C.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum cost of N items, or \xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to prepare N items.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n0\xe2\x89\xa4E,H\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B,C\xe2\x89\xa4106\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5 4 4 2 2 2\n4 5 5 1 2 3\n4 5 5 3 2 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n-1\n7\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The maximum number of items that can be produced using 4 eggs and 4 chocolates is 4, so the answer is \xe2\x88\x921.\nExample case 2: In the optimal solution, the friends should order 2 omelettes, 1 chocolate milkshake and 1 chocolate cake, with cost 1\xe2\x8b\x852+2\xe2\x8b\x851+3\xe2\x8b\x851=7.\nExample case 3: In the optimal solution, the friends should order 4 chocolate cakes, with cost 1\xe2\x8b\x854=4.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COLGLF4\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, ad-hoc, Brute Force, Implementation, Linear Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1856\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
