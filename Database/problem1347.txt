b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nThis morning Chef wants to jump a little. In a few minutes he will arrive at the point 0. Then he will perform a lot of jumps in such a sequence: 1-jump, 2-jump, 3-jump, 1-jump, 2-jump, 3-jump, 1-jump, and so on.\n1-jump means that if Chef is at the point x, he will jump to the point x+1. \n2-jump means that if Chef is at the point x, he will jump to the point x+2. \n3-jump means that if Chef is at the point x, he will jump to the point x+3. \nBefore the start Chef asks you: will he arrive at the point a after some number of jumps?\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer a denoting the point Chef asks about. \nOutput\nOutput "yes" without a quotes if Chef can arrive at point a or "no" without a quotes otherwise.\nConstraints\n\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 a \xe2\x89\xa4 1018\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 3\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 3\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nno\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 4\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 4\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 5\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 5\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 6\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 6\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 7\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 7\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nno\n\n\nExplanation\n The first reached points are: 0 (+1) 1 (+2) 3 (+3) 6 (+1) 7, and so on. \n\n\n\nAuthor:\nberezin\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/OJUMPS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Divisibility, Binary Search on Answer\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Modular Arithmetic, Algorithms, Searching, Binary Search\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1232\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-02-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
