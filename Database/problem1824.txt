The value of a perfect tree with n vertices at a time x is\nW(x)=maxp(n\xe2\x88\x91i=1dist(pi)\xe2\x8b\x85xi\xe2\x88\x921),\nwhere the vertices of the tree are (arbitrarily) numbered 1 through n, the maximum is taken over all permutations p of integers 1 through n, and dist(u) denotes the distance of vertex u from the root.\nOur Chef has a perfect tree with N vertices (numbered 1 through N), which is rooted at vertex 1. For any vertex v of this tree, the value of the subtree rooted at v (note that it is also a perfect tree) is defined in the same way as above, where the sum and permutations are only taken over vertices of this subtree and dist() denotes the distance from vertex v.\nYou should answer Q queries. In each query, Chef has two parametres v and y and he wants to know the value of the subtree rooted at vertex v, at time y. The queries are encoded in such a way that they have to be answered online. Since the values may be large, compute them modulo 1000000007 (109+7).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.\nEach of the following N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting an edge between vertices u and v.\nThe following Q lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers a and b. The parametres v and y are computed in the following way: let's denote the answer to the previous query by ans (ans=0 for the first query); then, v=a\xe2\x8a\x95ans and y=b\xe2\x8a\x95ans.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer - the value of the given subtree modulo 109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4100,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4y<109+7\nthe graph described on the input is a perfect tree\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 200,000\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 100,000\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (20 points) : \n1\xe2\x89\xa4 Sum of N over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa410000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4 Sum of Q over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa48000\nSubtask 2 (80 points) : \nOriginal Constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6 3\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 6\n1 1\n10 10\n5 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8\n6\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: For the first query, the choice of the permutation p is irrelevant, the inner sum (and therefore the value of the tree) is always just the sum of distances of all vertices from vertex 1. Hence, the answer is 0+1+1+2+2+2=8.\nIn the second query, v=2 and y=2.\nIn the third query, v=3 and y=3.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85yash_chandnani\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PTREE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Modulo Multiplicative Inverse, GP, DFS, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Mathematics, Modular Arithmetic, Sequences and Progression, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2900\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-02-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
