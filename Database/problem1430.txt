b"\nGiven two integers N and \xcf\x83, find any array a with length N such that the standard deviation of the elements of the array is equal to \xcf\x83. The standard deviation is given by the following formula:\n\n\n\nFor each 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N, ai may be any real number with |ai| \xe2\x89\xa4 108.\nIf there is more than one possible answer, you may output any one of them. If there is no such array, output -1 instead.\nPlease note that the denominator only contains N. (In the usual formula for standard deviation, N-1 is used. That's not the definition we're using here.)\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, \xcf\x83.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing N space-separated real numbers denoting the elements of the array a.\nIf it is not possible to construct such an array, output -1 instead. If there is more than one possible solution, you may output any one.\nYour answer will be considered correct if the standard deviation of the printed array doesn't differ from \xcf\x83 by more than 10-2 in absolute value.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 \xcf\x83 \xe2\x89\xa4 105\nSum of N over all test cases won't exceed 106\n\nExample\nInput\n3\n2 2\n3 3\n4 0\n\nOutput\n2 6\n3.5 2 8.979967\n3 3 3 3\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-10-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, PYPY\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
