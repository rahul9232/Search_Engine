b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nBob and Alice are playing a game with the following rules:\n\nInitially, they have an integer sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN; in addition, Bob has a lucky number aa and Alice has a lucky number b.\nThe players alternate turns. In each turn, the current player must remove a non-zero number of elements from the sequence; each removed element should be a multiple of the lucky number of this player.\nIf it is impossible to remove any elements, the current player loses the game.\n\nIt is clear that one player wins the game after a finite number of turns. Find the winner of the game if Bob plays first and both Bob and Alice play optimally.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, a and b.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "ALICE" if the winner is Alice or "BOB" if the winner is Bob (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (18 points): a=b\nSubtask #2 (82 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5 3 2\n1 2 3 4 5\n5 2 4\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nALICE\nBOB\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Bob removes 3 and the sequence becomes [1,2,4,5]. Then, Alice removes 2 and the sequence becomes [1,4,5]. Now, Bob is left with no moves, so Alice is the winner.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85hruday968\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HP18\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1500\n\n\nDate Added:\n11-12-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
