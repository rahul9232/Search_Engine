b'\n          \n            Once upon a time there lived a "Lucky" guy named Devdas. Paaro and Chandramukhi were two best friends. Both of them liked him. On the occassion of his homecoming, both the girls decided to give him a present to impress him.\n\nKnowing that Devdas was a coder and he was very fond of palindromic subsequences of a string, Chandramukhi decided to gift him the longest subsequence of Dev\'s favourite string S which is a palindrome.\n\nPaaro somehow got to know Chandramukhi\'s plan and decided to do something more impressive. She wants to gift a subsequence of the string S, such that all subsequences of the given subsequence is a palindrome. As Paaro is not good with strings, she wants you to tell her how many such subsequences exist in the string S.\n\nYou can see the definition of subsequence and palindrome by clicking on the links.\n\nAs the answer may be very large, output it modulo 10^9+7.\n\n Input  \nThe first line contains the number of test cases.\nEach test case contains of the single line having string S.\nString S only consists of lowercase alphabets.\n\n Output  \nFor each test case output a single line containg the required answer.\n Constraints  \n1 < T < 100\n1 < |S| < 100\n\n Example  \n Input:  \n2\nabcd\naa\n Output:  \n4\n3\n\n Explanation  \nIn first test cases \'a\', \'b\', \'c\', \'d\' are subsequences having all their subsequences as palindromes.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85aaijmrt\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/INSQ16B\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 aaijmrt, ad-hoc, insomnia\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-09-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nJAVA, C, CPP14, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
