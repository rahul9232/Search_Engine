b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nChef usually likes to play cricket, but now, he is bored of playing it too much, so he is trying new games with strings. Chef\'s friend Dustin gave him binary strings S and R, each with length N, and told him to make them identical. However, unlike Dustin, Chef does not have any superpower and Dustin lets Chef perform only operations of one type: choose any pair of integers (i,j) such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4N and swap the i-th and j-th character of S. He may perform any number of operations (including zero).\nFor Chef, this is much harder than cricket and he is asking for your help. Tell him whether it is possible to change the string S to the target string R only using operations of the given type.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains a binary string S.\nThe third line contains a binary string R.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to change S to R or "NO" if it is impossible (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4400\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n|S|=|R|=N\nS and R will consist of only \'1\' and \'0\'\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5\n11000\n01001\n3\n110\n001\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Chef can perform one operation with (i,j)=(1,5). Then, S will be "01001", which is equal to R.\nExample case 2: There is no sequence of operations which would make S equal to R.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85ezio_26\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PLAYSTR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Arrays, Frequency Arrays\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1108\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-07-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
