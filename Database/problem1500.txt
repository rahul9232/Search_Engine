b'\n\nThe state space of the output of this problem (and as a matter of fact, all the problems in this Cook-Off) is - 2 to the power T -\nwhere T is the number of test cases (so be extra careful!). Each test case consists of T lines consisting of "YES" or "NO".\nIf a test case accurately represents the output that you would print for this file,\nthen print "YES" for this case. Print "NO" otherwise.\n\n\nThe output for a file is defined as the output for all the test cases one by one. If you output "YES" for test case \'x\', then your output\nmust match the input for the test case \'x\', and if and only if your output does not match the input for test case \'x\', should you print "NO"\nfor that case.\n\nInput\n\nThe first Line contains a single number T, the number of test cases.\n\n\nEach test case contains T lines. Each line is either "YES" or "NO". The T lines together represent the candidate output for this problem.\n\nOutput\n\nIf the candidate-output (that you got in the input) is what you are going to print then print "YES", and\nonly if it is different, print "NO". The output for each case must be on a single line by itself.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nThere is only one unique valid output that you can print\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\nNO\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNO\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\n\nYour output clearly matches the input for the second case.
