Coach Khaled is one of the richest men in the world. He has NN jewels (numbered 11 through NN); for each valid i, the i-th jewel has value Pi. The values of all jewels are pairwise distinct. Unfortunately for Khaled, one of the best thieves in the world, Ghoda, is trying to steal the jewels.\nKhaled knows that Ghoda wants to try to steal jewels during M days (numbered 1 through M). For each valid i, on the i-th day, consider all jewels with numbers between Li and Ri (inclusive) which Ghoda has not stolen yet. If there is at least one such jewel, Ghoda decides to steal one of these jewels: the most valuable one. Khaled can only choose one day and prevent Ghoda from stealing any jewels on that day; Ghoda can steal jewels on subsequent days in the same way.\nKhaled wants to maximise the sum of values of the jewels Ghoda has not stolen during these M days. Can you help him?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN.\nM lines follow. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4M), the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Li and Ri.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum possible sum of values of Khaled's remaining jewels.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nP1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN are pairwise distinct\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Li,Ri\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4 4\n1 2 4 3\n1 3\n3 4\n1 2\n2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Khaled can prevent Ghoda from stealing on day 2. Then, Ghoda steals the 3-rd jewel on the 1-st day and the 2-nd jewel on the 3-rd day; he cannot steal anything on the 4-th day. The remaining jewels are the 1-st and 4-th jewel, with values 1 and 3 respectively.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85i_love_islam\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SAVJEW\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Queues, Sets, Segment Trees\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2925\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-09-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
