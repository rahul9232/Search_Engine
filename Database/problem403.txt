b"\nOn the event of the Williams\xe2\x80\x99s 15th birthday, Williams\xe2\x80\x99s mom bought a big circular cake for him and garnished it with k nice looking candles placed equally spaced around the circumference of the big beautiful cake, i.e., the lengths of the arcs that connect any two adjacent candles are same .\nWilliam listed the candles from 1 to k in clockwise fashion. He then chose two candles, say  A and B and lit them up. Now, he left the cook room and decided to come back in later with his companion to celebrate the birthday.\nIn-between William's little sister came to the cook room and saw the big beautiful cake. She wants to light up one of the not lit candles C such that angle ACB is an obtuse angle. She thinks that such a pattern of lit candles will be auspicious. Can you find out how many candles  C She can light up?\nInput:\nThe first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case is described by a single line containing three space-separated integers k, A, B.\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output a single line containing one integer: the answer for the test case.\nConstraints\n \xc2\xb7 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n \xc2\xb7 3\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4105\n \xc2\xb7 1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa4k\n \xc2\xb7 A\xe2\x89\xa0B\nSample Input:\n3\n6 1 3\n6 1 4\n10 1 5\nSample Output:\n1\n0\n3\nEXPLANATION:\nExample case 1. Only candle with number 2 is suitable.\nExample case 2. No matter how we choose C the angle would have 90 degrees.\nExample case 3. Candles with numbers 2, 3, 4 are suitable.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85uttam_singhk\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SQMA01\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy, geometry, math, uttam_singhk\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-02-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
