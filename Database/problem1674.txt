You may change any number of its elements (possibly zero), obtaining a new sequence of positive integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BNB1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN. Each element of BB must be an integer between 2 and 50 (both inclusive).\nLet's define an undirected graph G with N vertices (numbered 1 through N). For each pair of different vertices i and j, there is an edge between i and j if and only if Bi and Bj are coprime.\nYou should choose the sequence B in such a way that G is a connected graph. The number of elements which need to be changed to obtain B from A should be minimum possible. Find one such sequence B and the minimum required number of changes.\nIt can be proven that a solution always exists \xe2\x80\x94 it is always possible to modify sequence A in such a way that G is connected.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print two lines. The first line should contain a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum required number of changes. The second line should contain N space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN \xe2\x80\x94 the modified sequence.\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any one.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450\n2\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa450 for each valid i\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\nExample Input\n2\n2\n2 3\n2\n2 4\n\nExample Output\n0\n2 3\n1\n2 3\n\nExplanation\nExample 1: There is an edge in G between vertices 1 and 2. This graph is connected, so there is no need to change any elements.\nExample 2: There is no edge between vertices 1 and 2 since gcd(2,4)\xe2\x89\xa01. This graph is not connected. We can change element A2=4 to 3 and make this graph connected.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin2\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ARRGRAPH\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Disjoint Set Union\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-10-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
