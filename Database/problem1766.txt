Construct a binary matrix such that its associated graph is isomorphic to G or determine that it does not exist.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nEach of the next M lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting an edge between vertices u and v.\n\nOutput\n\nIf there is no solution, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x88\x921.\nOtherwise:\nPrint one line containing two space-separated integers R and C - the number of rows and the number of columns of your matrix.\nThen, print R lines. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4R), the i-th of these lines should contain a string with length C describing the i-th row of the matrix. Each character of this string should be either '0' or '1'.\n\nThe number of cells of your matrix must be at most 105.\nConstraints\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe graph does not contain any self-loops or duplicate edges\n\nExample Input\n3 2\n1 2\n1 3\n\nExample Output\n1 3\n101\n\nExample Input\n3 3\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3\n\nExample Output\n-1\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85bciobanu\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HPIRATES\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, ad-hoc, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-11-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
