b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef lives in a country called ChefLand. The country can be represented as a tree of NN cities (numbered 11 through N) connected by N\xe2\x88\x921 roads. For each valid i, the cost of a house in city i is Ai.\nYou should answer Q queries. In each query, you are given cities u and v (possibly identical); Chef is planning to buy houses in these cities. Chef's happiness quotient is equal to the product of the costs of houses in all cities which lie on the simple path between u and v (both inclusive). Since Chef loves playing with factors, he is asking you to tell him the number of factors of his happiness quotient, modulo 1,000,000,007 (109+7).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers x and y denoting that cities x and y are connected by a road.\nThe following line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nThe following line contains a single integer Q.\nEach of the next Q lines contains two space-separated integers u and v describing a query.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of factors of the happiness quotient modulo 1,000,000,007 (109+7).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa43\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4103\nSubtask #2 (30 points): N\xe2\x89\xa4103\nSubtask #3 (60 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n2 6 4 3 5\n2\n1 4\n2 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n9\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85dvyn01\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FCTRE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Mo's Algorithm, Sieve of Eratosthenes, DFS Order\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Algorithms, Pre processing, Mathematics, Number Theory, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals, DFS\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-01-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n7.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
