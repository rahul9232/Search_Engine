Some of these sequences are magic sequences.\nA magic sequence with length NN is an integer sequence s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sNs1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sN with the following properties:\n\nAt least one of its elements is 0.\nFor each valid i, si is the distance of element si to the closest zero element. Formally, si is the minimum of |j\xe2\x88\x92i| over all valid indices j such that sj=0. Note that this definition is self-consistent: if we fix the positions of all zeroes in the sequence, it does not require any of these elements to be non-zero or any other elements to be zero.\n\nFor example, [0,1,2,1,0], [2,1,0,1,0,0] and [2,1,0,1,2] are magic sequences, but [1,1,0], [1] and [1,2,0,2] are not.\nDanya decided to determine how well Sonya is familiar with magic sequences, so he asked her a question. In this question, Danya gave Sonya a sequence a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN. Sonya must determine whether it is possible to rearrange (permute) the elements of this sequence in such a way that the resulting sequence is a magic sequence. If it is possible, she also needs to find one such resulting sequence.\nSince Sonya needs to take care of her sequences, she asks you to answer Danya\'s question.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf there is no solution, print a single line containing the string "No" (without quotes).\nOtherwise, print two lines. The first of these lines should contain the string "Yes" (without quotes). The second line should contain N space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x94 a permutation of a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN which forms a magic sequence. If there are multiple possible solutions, print any of them. \n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa43\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4104\n0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 104\n\nExample Input\n3\n4\n1 2 1 1\n8\n5 0 4 1 0 2 3 1\n11\n0 1 1 2 0 3 1 2 0 2 1\n\nExample Output\nNo\nYes\n0 1 0 1 2 3 4 5\nYes\n0 1 2 3 2 1 0 1 2 1 0\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85smelskiy\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MAGARR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, Observation, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-01-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
