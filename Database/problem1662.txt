Let's denote the height of the top of step i by hi. Chef Ada is currently under the staircase at height 0 and she wants to reach the top of the staircase (the top of the last step). However, she can only jump from height hi to the top of a step at height hf if hf\xe2\x88\x92hi\xe2\x89\xa4K. To help Ada, we are going to construct some intermediate steps; each of them may be constructed between any two steps, or before the first step, and have any height. What is the minimum number of steps that need to be added to the staircase so that Ada could reach the top?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.\nThe second line contains N space-seperated integers h1,h2,\xe2\x80\xa6,hN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum required number of steps.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa464\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4128\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41,024\n1\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa41,024 for each valid i\nhi<hi+1 for each valid i\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4 3\n2 4 8 16\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85alei\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ADASTAIR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1320\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-10-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
