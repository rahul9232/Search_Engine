No two of these intervals overlap \xe2\x80\x94 formally, for each valid i, j such that i\xe2\x89\xa0j, either Ri<Lj or Rj<Li.\nM people (numbered 1 through M) are planning to eat at the restaurant; let's denote the time when the i-th person arrives by Pi. If the restaurant is open at that time, this person does not have to wait, but if it is closed, this person will wait until it is open. Note that if this person arrives at an exact time when the restaurant is closing, they have to wait for the next opening time.\nFor each person, calculate how long they have to wait (possibly 0 time), or determine that they will wait forever for the restaurant to open.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nN lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Li and Ri.\nM lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains a single integer Pi.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print M lines. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines should contain a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the time person i has to wait, or \xe2\x88\x921 if person i has to wait forever.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Li<Ri\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthe intervals are pairwise disjoint\nthe sum of N for all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of M for all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n\nthe sum of N for all test cases does not exceed 1,000\nthe sum of M for all test cases does not exceed 1,000\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4 5\n5 7\n9 10\n2 3\n20 30\n5\n6\n7\n35\n1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n2\n-1\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nQuery 1: The person coming at time 5 does not have to wait as the restaurant is open in [5,7) slot.\nQuery 2: The person coming at time 6 does not have to wait as the restaurant is open in [5,7) slot.\nQuery 3: The person coming at time 7 has to wait since the restaurant is closed at time 7. The next slot in which the restaurant opens is [9,10).
