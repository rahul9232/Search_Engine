The junctions are depicted below and they form a hexagonal grid \xe2\x80\x94 they satisfy the following conditions:\n\nTwo of the junctions have coordinates (0,0)(0,0) and (1,0)(1,0).\nEach junction JJ is connected by line segments with six other junctions. These junctions are the vertices of a regular hexagon with side length 1 and their distances from J are also all equal to 1.\n\n\nChef created a robot that can traverse the junctions. Initially, it is in some junction and oriented towards another junction which is connected to it by a line segment. The robot accepts a string of instructions \xe2\x80\x94 decimal digits 0 through 5. It executes the instructions one by one and stops after executing the final instruction. When the robot executes an instruction denoted by a digit d, it first rotates by 60\xe2\x8b\x85d degrees counterclockwise and then moves 1 unit forward, to the junction it is oriented towards.\nChef wants to test the robot, so he wrote a string S of N instructions. You should answer Q queries. In each query, Chef wants to give the robot a substring of instructions SL,SL+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,SR; the robot starts in the junction (0,0) and it is oriented towards (1,0). You should find the final position (the x- and y-coordinates) of the robot.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.\nThe second line contains a single string S with length N.\nQ lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers L and R describing a query.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing two space-separated real numbers \xe2\x80\x94 the coordinates of the robot. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error of each coordinate does not exceed 10\xe2\x88\x926.\nWarning: Outputting more than 8 digits after floating point may result in exceeding output size limit and receiving "Runtime error" verdict.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N\nS contains only characters \'0\', \'1\', \'2\', \'3\', \'4\' and \'5\'\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nExample Input\n1\n3 3\n012\n1 1\n1 2\n2 2\n\nExample Output\n1.00000000 0.00000000\n1.50000000 0.86602540\n0.50000000 0.86602540\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ROBOTS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Segment Trees, Geometry, Trigonometry, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Mathematics, Basic Maths, Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2505\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-11-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
