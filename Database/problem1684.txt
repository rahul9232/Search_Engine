b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nYou are given a grid with N rows and M columns, where each cell contains either \'0\' or \'1\'. \nFind out whether all the cells containing \'1\'-s form a rectangle, I.e, is there a rectangular contiguous subgrid such that every cell within it is a \'1\', and all the cells containing \'1\'-s are within this subgrid.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nN lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains a single string with length M describing the i-th row of the grid.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if the connected component of \'1\'-s is a rectangle or "NO" if it is not.\nNote: The output is case-insensitive \xe2\x80\x95 each letter may be printed in upper case or lower case.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4500\nSum of N\xe2\x88\x97M over all tests is atmost 1.5\xe2\x88\x97106\nEach string contains only characters \'0\' and \'1\'\nIt is guaranteed that grid contains at least a single \'1\'\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3 3\n010\n111\n010\n4 4\n0000\n0110\n1110\n1100\n3 3\n011\n011\n000\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The minimal rectangle which covers all \'1\'-s also covers 4 cells which contain \'0\'-s.\nExample case 2: The minimal rectangle which covers all \'1\'-s also covers 2 cells which contain \'0\'-s.\nExample case 3: We can form a minimal rectangle with side length 2 which covers all cells containing \'1\'-s and none of the cells containing \'0\'-s.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ISREC\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1942\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
