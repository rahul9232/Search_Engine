b'\nYou have an array PP of length NN. Also in front of you, there are NN bags of gems lined up in a row where the i-th bag from the left has 2Pi gems in it. \nYou can take any bags of gems from them following the given rules:\n\nYou are not allowed to take two adjacent bags. \nYou are allowed to take at most k bags.\n\nFor each value of k from 1 to \xe2\x8c\x88N2\xe2\x8c\x89, find the maximum number of gems you can obtain.\nSince the answers may be too large, print them modulo 109+7.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N - the number of bags of gems.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing \xe2\x8c\x88N2\xe2\x8c\x89 integers. The k-th of them is the maximum number of gems you can obtain if you take no more than k bags, modulo 109+7. \nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n3\n0 3 0\n4\n1 3 2 0\n6\n2 4 4 3 3 1\n5\n5 5 5 5 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8 8\n8 9\n16 24 28\n32 64 96\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case-1:\n\nFor k=1: It is optimal to pick index: 2. Therefore the number of gems =2P2=8.\nFor k=2: Optimal selection is exactly same.\n\nTest Case-3:\n\nFor k=1: It is optimal to pick indices: 3. Therefore the number of gems =2P3=16.\nFor k=2: It is optimal to pick indices: 2,5. Therefore the number of gems =2P2+2P5=24.\nFor k=3: It is optimal to pick indices: 1,3,5. Therefore the number of gems =2P1+2P3+2P5=28.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndannyboy1204\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85tabr\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PO2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 cook139, dannyboy1204, disjoint-set-union, greedy, medium\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3156\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-03-2022\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
