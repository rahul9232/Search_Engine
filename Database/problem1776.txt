b"\nRead problems statements Bengali , Mandarin chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given two integer sequences A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN and B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BNB1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN.\nWe define the similarity of the sequences A and B as the number of indices i such that Ai=Bi.\nYou should process Q queries. In each query, you are given parameters l, r and c; you should change each of the elements Al,Al+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ar to c, and then compute the similarity of the sequences A and B.\nChef knows that this is simple, so he asks you to answer the queries online. Note that the input is given in a special format to ensure that.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nThe third line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN.\nEach of the next Q lines contains three space-separated integers x, y and z describing a query in the following format:\nLet's denote the similarity of A and B before this query by Pr (for the first query, Pr is the similarity of the initial sequences).\nFor this query, l=x\xe2\x8a\x95Pr, r=y\xe2\x8a\x95Pr and c=z\xe2\x8a\x95Pr.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the similarity after this query.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,Bi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1 (20 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa42,000\nSubtask 2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4 3\n1 2 3 4\n1 1 3 5\n0 1 0\n0 5 3\n1 4 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The similarity before any query is applied is 2 (the sequences match at positions 1 and 3).\nIn the first query, l=2, r=3, c=2. The similarity after this query is 1 (the only match is at position 1).\nIn the second query, l=1, r=4, c=2. The similarity after this query is 0 (no match at any position).\nIn the third query, l=1, r=4, c=1. The similarity after this query is 2 (two matches at positions 1 and 2).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85teja349\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MATCH2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sets, Merge Sort Tree, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2732\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-09-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
