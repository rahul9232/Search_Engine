b"\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nChef Ada is building a new restaurant in the following way:\n\nFirst, NN points X1,X2,\xe2\x80\xa6,XNX1,X2,\xe2\x80\xa6,XN are chosen on the xx-axis.\nThen, N columns (numbered 1 through N) are made. For simplicity, the columns are represented as vertical segments; for each valid i, the height of the i-th segment is Hi.\nAda assigns a column to each of the points X1,X2,\xe2\x80\xa6,XN in an arbitrary way (each column must be assigned to exactly one point).\nFinally, Ada constructs the roof of the restaurant, represented by a polyline with N vertices. Let's denote the column assigned to the i-th point by Pi. For each valid i, the i-th of these vertices is (Xi,HPi), i.e. the polyline joins the tops of the columns from left to right.\n\nAda wants the biggest restaurant. Help her choose the positions of the columns in such a way that the area below the roof is the biggest possible. Formally, she wants to maximise the area of the polygon whose perimeter is formed by the roof and the segments (XN,HPN)\xe2\x88\x92(XN,0)\xe2\x88\x92(X1,0)\xe2\x88\x92(X1,HP1). Let S be this maximum area; you should compute 2\xe2\x8b\x85S (it is guaranteed that 2\xe2\x8b\x85S is an integer).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nN lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Xi and Hi.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer 2\xe2\x8b\x85S.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4X1<X2<\xe2\x80\xa6<XN\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Hi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n4 4\n5 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85alei\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BIGRES\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Geometry, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2184\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-08-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
