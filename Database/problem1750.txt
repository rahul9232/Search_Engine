b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nThere are two circles in a plane. The radius of the first circle is R1R1, while the radius of the second circle is R2R2. The coordinates of the centre of the first circle are (X1,Y1)(X1,Y1), while the coordinates the centre of the second circle are (X2,Y2).\nConsider all points P with the following properties:\n\nP lies strictly inside the first circle or on its perimeter.\nP lies strictly outside the second circle.\n\nDetermine whether at least one point with these properties exists. If it exists, find one such point.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains six space-separated integers X1, Y1, R1, X2, Y2 and R2.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a line containing the string "YES" if there is a point P=(X,Y) with the given properties or "NO" otherwise. If there is such a point, print a second line containing two space-separated real numbers X and Y.\nThe coordinates X and Y will be considered correct if the distance of the point (X,Y) from the centre of the first circle is at most R1+10\xe2\x88\x926 and its distance from the centre of the second circle is at least R2\xe2\x88\x9210\xe2\x88\x926. Note that these conditions are not used to check the existence of the answer, their only purpose is to check the correctness of the coordinates X and Y with floating point precision.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100,000\n|X1|,|Y1|,|X2|,|Y2|\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4R1,R2\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nExample Input\n3\n0 0 2 0 0 3\n5 5 1 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0 2 2\n\nExample Output\nNO\nYES\n5.0000000 5.0000000\nNO\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CIRCLES2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Geometry, Trigonometry\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Basic Maths\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2391\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-08-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
