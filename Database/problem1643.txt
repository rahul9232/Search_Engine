b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef Leonardo has a decimal integer N and a non-zero decimal digit d. N does not contain the digit zero; specifically, N should always be treated as a decimal integer without leading zeroes.\nChef likes d and does not like any other digit, so he decided to change N. He may apply the following operation any number of times (including zero): append the digit d to the decimal representation of N (d becomes the least significant digit of N), then remove one occurrence of one digit from the decimal representation of N.\nChef has already changed a lot of numbers and he got bored. Now, he wants to know the smallest possible value of N which can be obtained by performing the operation described above. Can you help him?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and d.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the minimum number Chef can obtain.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41018\nN does not contain the digit 0\n1\xe2\x89\xa4d\xe2\x89\xa49\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (40 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtask #2 (60 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n35 4\n42 4\n24 9\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n34\n24\n24\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Chef can remove the digit 5 and add 4 to the end of N. Then, N becomes 34.\nExample case 2: Chef can remove the digit 4 from the beginning of N, add 4 to the end of N and get N=24.\nExample case 3: Chef cannot make his number any smaller.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85aleex\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHDIGER\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Arithmetic, Observation, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Basic Maths, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1574\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-02-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
