He wrote some positive integers a, b, c, d on a paper. Chef wants to know whether he can shuffle these numbers so as to make some proportion? Formally, four numbers x, y, z, w are said to make a proportion if ratio of x : y is same as that of z : w.\nInput\nOnly line of the input contains four space separated positive integers - a, b, c, d.\nOutput\nPrint "Possible" if it is possible to shuffle a, b, c, d to make proportion, otherwise "Impossible" (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 a, b, c, d  \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 2 4 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPossible\n\n\nExplanation\nBy swapping 4 and the second 2, we get 1 2 2 4. Note that 1 2 2 4 make proportion as 1 : 2 = 2 : 4. Hence answer is "Possible"\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85karanaggarwal\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFCBA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Brute Force\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1122\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-07-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
