On the other hand, Chef was busy in the kitchen, so he in turn asked you to help Shubham.\nYou are given a sequence of positive integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN and an integer KK. For any positive integer XX such that exactly K bits in the binary representation of X are equal to 1, consider the sum S=\xe2\x88\x91Ni=1(X\xe2\x88\xa7Ai); here, \xe2\x88\xa7 denotes bitwise AND. You should choose X in such a way that S is maximum possible. If there is more than one such value of X, you should find the smallest one.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest possible value of X.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa430\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): K\xe2\x89\xa42\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4 1\n3 4 5 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Exactly one bit in X should be 1. Our options are:\n\nIf X=1, S=1+0+1+1=3.\nIf X=2, S=2+0+0+0=2.\nIf X=4, S=0+4+4+0=8.\nFor any greater valid X, S=0.\n\nThe maximum value of S is 8, so the answer is the only value of X where we get S=8.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85dean_student\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MAXAND18\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bitwise Operation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Bit Manipulation\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1908\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-04-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
