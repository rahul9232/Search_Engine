From both of them, teams can qualify to the pre-elimination round. According to the rules, in each of these two rounds, teams are sorted in descending order by their score and each team with a score greater or equal to the score of the team at the K=1500K=1500-th place advances to the pre-elimination round (this means it is possible to have more than KK qualified teams from each round in the case of one or more ties after the KK-th place).\nToday, the organizers ask you to count the number of teams which would qualify for the pre-elimination round from round A for a given value of K (possibly different from 1500). They provided the scores of all teams to you; you should ensure that all teams scoring at least as many points as the K-th team qualify.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of qualified teams.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthe sum of N for all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nExample Input\n2\n5 1\n3 5 2 4 5\n6 4\n6 5 4 3 2 1\n\nExample Output\n2\n4\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/QUALPREL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n10-10-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
