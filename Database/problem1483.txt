Mathematicians have developed many criteria according to which a triangle can be classified. In this problem, you will be asked to classify some triangles according to their sides and angles.\n\n\nAccording to their measure, angles may be:\n\n  Acute \xe2\x80\x94 an angle that is less than 90 degrees\n    Right \xe2\x80\x94 a 90-degrees angle\n    Obtuse \xe2\x80\x94 an angle that is greater than 90 degrees\n  \nAccording to their sides, triangles may be:\n\n  Scalene \xe2\x80\x94 all sides are different\n    Isosceles \xe2\x80\x94 exactly two sides are equal\n  \nAccording to their angles, triangles may be:\n  \n  Acute \xe2\x80\x94 all angles are acute\n    Right \xe2\x80\x94 one angle is right\n    Obtuse \xe2\x80\x94 one angle is obtuse\n  Triangles with three equal sides (equilateral triangles) will not appear in the test data.\nThe triangles formed by three collinear points are not considered in this problem. In order to classify a triangle, you should use only the adjactives from the statement. There is no triangle which could be described in two different ways according to the classification characteristics considered above.\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer SUBTASK_ID denoting the subtask id this input belongs to.\nThe second line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains six integers x1, y1, x2, y2, x3 and y3 denoting Cartesian coordinates of points, that form the triangle to be classified.\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the points are non-collinear.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the classification of the given triangle.\nIf SUBTASK_ID equals 1, then the classification should follow the "<Side classification starting with a capital letter> triangle" format.\nIf SUBTASK_ID equals 2, then the classification should follow the "<Side classification starting with a capital letter> <angle classification> triangle" format.\nPlease, check out the samples section to better understand the format of the output.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 60\n|xi|, |yi| \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nSubtask 1 (50 points): no additional constraints\nSubtask 2 (50 points): no additional constraints\nNote\n\nThe first test of the first subtask and the first test of the second subtask are the example tests (each in the corresponding subtask). It\'s made for you to make sure that your solution produces the same verdict both on your machine and our server.\n\nTip\n\nConsider using the following condition in order to check whether two floats or doubles A and B are equal instead of traditional A == B: |A - B| < 10-6.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n0 0 1 1 1 2\n3 0 0 4 4 7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nScalene triangle\nIsosceles triangle\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n6\n0 0 4 1 1 3\n0 0 1 0 1 2\n0 0 1 1 1 2\n0 0 2 1 1 2\n3 0 0 4 4 7\n0 0 2 1 4 0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nScalene acute triangle\nScalene right triangle\nScalene obtuse triangle\nIsosceles acute triangle\nIsosceles right triangle\nIsosceles obtuse triangle\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kostya_by\n\n\nTester:\n4\xe2\x98\x85pavel1996\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TRIANGCL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, cakewalk, geometry, kostya_by, ltime32\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1462\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-12-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
