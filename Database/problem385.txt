b'\nReady for another Assignment? But don\'t worry this one is easy.\nRemember how we used to convert numbers in p/q form to decimal form in Number System?\nLet\'s do it again !\nA number will be given to you in form of p/q where p and q are positive integers. Your task is to convert this expression into decimal form.\nif you get 10/2 as an input expression, it\'s decimal conversion will be 5.\nor for 3/5 decimal conversion is 0.6.\nTold you it\'s easy one.\nBut the Problem begins now.\nIf the solution has recurring decimals (Repeating recursively) then denote the repeating decimals by enclosing them between "[ ]";\nfor 2/3 decimal conversion will be 0.66666\xe2\x80\xa6.infinitely.   so print the solution as 0.[6];\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nThe description of T test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single String S in form of "p/q".  \nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line.\nif the decimal is non-repeating recursively then print solution in decimal form and then "regular" ( without quotes) .\nif the decimal is repeating recursively then print solution in decimal form and then  "vinculum" ( without quotes) .  \nConstraints\n1 <= T <= 100\n1 <= p,q <= 10^5\nSample Input\n2\n2/5\n8/3  \nSample Output\n0.4  regular\n2.[6]  vinculum \nExplanation\nsample case 2 : As dividing 8 by 3 we get output as 2.66666\xe2\x80\xa6.. .Here 6 is repeating recursively. So, 6 is enclosed in "[ ]".\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85rnkjoshi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/INNOV106\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 hashing, inno2020, math, rnkjoshi\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-09-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
