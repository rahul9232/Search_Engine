b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nWhen Varsha was travelling home, she saw a mysterious villa. Varsha is curious about this strange villa and wants to explore it. When she reached the entry gate, the guard gave her a problem to solve and said that he would allow her to enter the villa only if she solved it.\nThe guard gave Varsha two integers X and K. Varsha needs to determine whether there is an integer A such that it has exactly X positive integer divisors and exactly K of them are prime numbers.\nVarsha found this problem really hard to solve. Can you help her?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers X and K.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer: 1 if a valid integer A exists or 0 if it does not exist.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X,K\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (15 points):\n\nT\xe2\x89\xa4100\nK\xe2\x89\xa42\n\nSubtask #2 (85 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: A=6 has X=4 factors: 1, 2, 3 and 6.
