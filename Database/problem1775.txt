The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains an integers N.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of divisors possible of the resulting number.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nSubtasks\n\n100 points : original constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n3\n64\n30\n120\n45\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We cannot divide N=3 by any valid K and hence output is 2 as N=3 has exactly two divisors 1 and 3.  \nExample case 2: N=64 can be divided by 8 twice as 8 has exactly 4 divisors ( 1, 2, 4, 8 )  and hence the resultant value of N will be 1 and 1 has only 1 divisor hence answer is 1.   \nExample case 3: We can divide N=30 by 6, 10 or 15 as all three of them have exactly 4 divisors. In each case resultant value of N will be either 5, 3 or 2. And all three of them has exactly 2 divisors and they cannot be divided further. Hence the output is 2.     \nExample case 4: One of the optimal ways to divide N=120 is divide 120 by 8 followed by dividing  by 15. The resultant value will be 120/8=15 and 15/15=1. The number 1 has exactly one divisor and hence output is 1.\nNote that, If we divided N=120 by 6 then we won't get the optimal answer.       \nExample case 5: We can divide N=45 by 15 and resultant value of N will be 3. The number 3 has exactly 2 divisors and hence output is 2\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsmit_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DIVISOR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Loops, Pre processing, Sieve of Eratosthenes, Divisors, Dynamic Programming, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Basic Programming Concepts, Advanced Algorithms, Mathematics, Number Theory, Integer Factorisation, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2932\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-01-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
