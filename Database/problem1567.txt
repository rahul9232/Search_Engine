Chefina asked Chef to reorder the elements of this sequence (possibly leaving it unchanged) in such a way that the resulting sequence would be good \xe2\x80\x95 if it is possible. However, that was an easy task for Chef, so whenever it is possible to make the given sequence good, Chefina asked him to do it by swapping adjacent pairs of its elements and to use the smallest possible number of swaps.\nFind the smallest number of swaps Chef needs to perform in order to make the given sequence good or determine that there is no way to make it good.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest number of swaps Chef needs to make the sequence good or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid ii\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa41,000N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 5,0005,000\n\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n3 6 7\n2\n4 4\n7\n2 3 9 13 14 6 13\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n-1\n5\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85rishup_nitdgp\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFPART\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Bitwise Operation, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Bit Manipulation, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3461\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-08-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
