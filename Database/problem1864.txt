b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese\n, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nThere's no story in this problem, it's time for trees!\nThe company structure of ShareChat can be viewed as a tree with N nodes (numbered 1 through N); node 1 is the root of this tree. You should choose a (possibly empty) subset of nodes and place one coin in each node from this set. We call the tree proper if the following condition holds:\n\nConsider two arbitrary disjont subtrees. Let's denote the total number of coins in one subtree by X and the total number of coins in the other subtree by Y.\nIf X>0 and Y>0, the greatest common divisior (GCD) of X and Y must be 1.\n\nPlease calculate the number of different assignments of coins to nodes (different sets of nodes containing coins) such that the resulting tree is proper. Since the answer could be very big, compute it modulo 109+7.\nNote: A subtree is the tree formed by some node v and all (direct or indirect) descendants of v. Two subtrees are disjont if they do not have any common node.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer N denoting the number of nodes in the tree.\nThe second line contains N\xe2\x88\x921 space-separated integers p2,p3,\xe2\x80\xa6,pN, where pi denotes the parent of node i.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of assignments of coins to nodes which form a proper tree, modulo 109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa470\n1\xe2\x89\xa4pi<i for each valid i\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n1 1 2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\nExplanation\nThere are only two ways to assign coins to nodes such that the resulting tree is not proper. Both contain coins in nodes 2, 3, 4, 5 and one of them contains a coin in node 1 too.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85allllekssssa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/STTT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 GCD, Bitmasking, Combinatorics, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Bit Manipulation, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3206\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-08-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
