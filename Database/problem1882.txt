More formally, given two intervals [l,r] and [L,R], the corresponding submatrix consists of the values aij such that l\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4r and L\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4R. Two submatrices are considered different if one of the ranges [l,r] or [L,R] differs.\nChef uses f(X) to denote the total number of submatrices B in which max(B)\xe2\x8a\x95min(B)=X,\nwhere \xe2\x8a\x95 denotes bitwise XOR, max(B) denotes the maximum integer in B, and min(B) denotes the minimum integer in B.\nChef does not know in which order he would like to put the rows. He wishes to know the value of f(X) for every permutation of rows, but since the amount of them can be too large, he wants to know the sum of the answers over all permutations.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three space-separated integers N, M and X.\nNext N lines contains M integers each: the j-th integer of the i-th line Aij.\n\nOutput\nOutput the sum of f(X) over all permutations of the rows of A.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa48\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4X,Aij\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3 3 3\n1 2 1\n0 3 0\n2 1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n120\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85karpovich\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MAXXMIN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Coordinate Compression, Bitmasking, Combinatorics, Two pointers\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Pre processing, Mathematics, Bit Manipulation, Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3629\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-05-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
