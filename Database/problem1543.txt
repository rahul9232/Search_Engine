b"\nYour have written the numbers 1, 2, ..., n on a blackboard in that order. You are given m distinct pairs of integers 1 \xe2\x89\xa4  x_i,y_i \xe2\x89\xa4  n. You can perform several operations, where in a single operation you select a given pair (x_i, y_i) and swap the x_i'th and y_i'th numbers from the left. Note that the numbers written on the blackboard at any time is a permutation of 1, 2, ..., n. Find the number of possible permutations that can be written on the blackboard after a finite amount of operations. (You can use a pair as many times as you wish.)\nSince the answer can be large, print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7)  \nInput\n\n The first line contains two integers: n and m. \nThe following m lines contain two integers each: x and y, meaning that (x, y) is one of the pairs you are allowed to swap. \n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single line: the answer to the problem.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4  n \xe2\x89\xa4  100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4  m \xe2\x89\xa4  200000\n\nExample\nInput:\n4 2\n1 3\n2 4\n\nOutput:\n4\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. You can use the pair (1, 3) to obtain the permutation [3, 2, 1, 4]. You can use the pair (2, 4) to obtain the permutation [1, 4, 3, 2]. You can use the pairs (1, 3), (2, 4) in that order to obtain the permutation [3, 4, 1, 2]. Another option is not using any pairs at all, this gives the permutation [1, 2, 3, 4]. These are the 4 permutations you can obtain. \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85AnonymousBunny\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 AnonymousBunny, ad-hoc, easy, ipc15p3a\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-02-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
