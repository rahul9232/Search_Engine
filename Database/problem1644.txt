b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has two positive integers AA and BB. He can tamper with them by choosing a digit in the decimal representation of AA and a digit in the decimal representation of B and swapping these digits. This operation may be performed at most once.\nFind the maximum possible sum of the resulting numbers which Chef can obtain. \nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers A and B.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum sum.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa499\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n13 82\n9 24\n20 30\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n104\n96\n50\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Swapping the digits 1 (from 13) and 2 (from 82) gives us 23 and 81. Their sum 23+81=104 is the maximum possible sum.\nExample case 3: Swapping is not needed as the original numbers have the maximum possible sum.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85hasinfarhan\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SWPDGT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Brute Force, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-03-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
