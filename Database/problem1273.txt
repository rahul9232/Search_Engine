b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese\n, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nTumut, the best programmer in his village Applidz, invented a problem and decided to share it with you:\nYou are given two integer sequences S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SNS1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SN and T1,T2,\xe2\x80\xa6,TMT1,T2,\xe2\x80\xa6,TM and an integer x. You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times:\n\nchoose an element of S and an element of T (let's denote them by Si and Tj respectively)\ndecrease both Si and Tj by x, i.e. replace Si by Si\xe2\x88\x92x and Tj by Tj\xe2\x88\x92x\n\nLet's denote the minimum and maximum value in the sequence S after performing the chosen operations (possibly none) by minS and maxS respectively. Similarly, let's denote the minimum and maximum value in T after performing the chosen operations by minT and maxT respectively. The goal is minimizing the expression (maxS+maxT)\xe2\x88\x92(minS+minT). Compute the minimum value of this expression. \nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers N, M and x.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers S1,S2\xe2\x80\xa6SN.\nThe third line contains M space-separated integers T1,T2\xe2\x80\xa6TM.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum possible value of the expression (maxS+maxT)\xe2\x88\x92(minS+minT).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ti\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n\nN,M\xe2\x89\xa420\nSi\xe2\x89\xa420 for each valid i\nTi\xe2\x89\xa420 for each valid i\n\nSubtask #2 (30 points):\n\nN,M\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nSi\xe2\x89\xa41,000 for each valid i\nTi\xe2\x89\xa41,000 for each valid i\n\nSubtask #3 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2 2 3\n1 8\n2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nWe can perform these two operations:\n\ndecrease S2 and T1 by x\ndecrease S2 and T2 by x\n\nAfterwards, the sequence S will be [1,2] and the sequence T will be [\xe2\x88\x921,0]. The resulting value of the given expression is (2+0)\xe2\x88\x92(1+(\xe2\x88\x921))=2. It is impossible to obtain a smaller value no matter how many operations are performed.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85allllekssssa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/XTGR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Number Theory, Greedy, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2759\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-08-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
