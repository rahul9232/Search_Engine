Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains a single line of input, two integers g, c.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem. We can show that under the constraints, the answer is an integer.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4g\xe2\x89\xa410\n1000\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa43000\n2\xe2\x8b\x85g divides c2.\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): Original constraints\nSample Input\n3\n7 1400\n5 1000\n10 1000\n\nSample Output\n140000\n100000\n50000\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: For Chef to achieve the speed of light, the minimum height required is c22\xe2\x8b\x85g = 1400\xe2\x8b\x85140014 = 140000 meters.\nTest Case 3: For Chef to achieve the speed of light, the minimum height required is c22\xe2\x8b\x85g = 1000\xe2\x8b\x85100020 = 50000 meters.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/RELATIVE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Physics, Mathematics, Brute Force\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-06-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
