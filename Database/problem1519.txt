b'\nChef became fascinated by the group of Anonymous Hackers and want to become a hacker so he asked his friend Alex to teach him hacking. Alex agreed on a condition that she will give him a text that he has to decrypt\n, if he can do it then only she\'ll teach him hacking and if he couldn\'t solve it then he will have to give her his favorite toy.\nChef agreed but as he asked Alex to give him an example so that he can understand how to decrypt it. Alex gave him an example which chef analyzed and found that the encryption of the text was done by an algorithm according to which -\n\nReplacing letters \'a\'-\'m\' with \'n\'-\'z\' \n\nReplacing letters \'n\'-\'z\' with \'a\'-\'m\' \n\nReplacing letters \'A\'-\'M\' with \'N\'-\'Z\' \n\nReplacing letters \'N\'-\'Z\' with \'A\'-\'M\' \n\nAlso, replacing digits \'0\'-\'4\' with \'5\'-\'9\' \n\nand replacing digits \'5\'-\'9\' with \'0\'-\'4\' \n\nwill give him the desired output. But as the text is too long to decode by him he asked you his friend to help him write a program to decrypt the text. \n\nNote : that spaces are left unchanged and the case of the letter is taken in consideration.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows."\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the length of the Text.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string S denoting the Encrypted Text.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the Decrypted Text\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 103\nS will contains [ \'A\'-\'Z\', \'a\'-\'z\', \'0\'-\'9\' ]\nThere will not be any consecutive spaces i.e. no consecutive two spaces.\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n\n2\n9\nUryYbPuRs\n22\nJrYpBzr gb UnPxvAt 552\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\nHelLoChEf\nWeLcOme to HaCkiNg 007\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n1\xe2\x98\x85rahul_ojha_07\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CTEXT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, rahul_ojha_07, strings\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n22-01-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
