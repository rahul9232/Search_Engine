b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nIn a country called Chef Land, there was a lot of monetary fraud, so Chefu, the head of the country, decided to choose new denominations of the local currency \xe2\x80\x95 all even-valued coins up to an integer N should exist. After a few days, a citizen complained that there was no way to create an odd value, so Chefu decided that he should also introduce coins with value 1. Formally, you are given an integer N; for v=1 and each even positive integer v\xe2\x89\xa4N, coins with value v exist.\nYou are also given an integer S. To handle transactions quickly, find the minimum number of coins needed to pay a price S.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers S and N.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of coins.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa4109\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\nN is even\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2 2\n1 14\n30 10\n31 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n9\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: One coin with value 2 is sufficient.\nExample case 2: We need to use one coin with value 1.\nExample case 3: We need 3 coins, each with value 10.\nExample case 4: We can use seven coins with value 4, one coin with value 2 and one coin with value 1.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85dean_student\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHFMOT18\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Case work, Conditional Statements, Basic Maths, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Basic Programming Concepts, Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1250\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
