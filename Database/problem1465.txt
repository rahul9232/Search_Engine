b"\nAlice has N pieces of paper.\nThese papers are numbered from 1 to N.\nShe writes down the numbers 1 to N in order (one number on each paper),\ni.e. paper i has number i written on it.\nBob messes the numbers on these papers.\nHe either adds a constant to a number or subtracts a constant from the number.\nHe performs M such operations.\nEach operation is of the form: w x y z where each of them is an integer.\nIf w = 1, then Alice has to add z to every number on papers x to y (both inclusive).\nIf w = 2, then Alice has to subtract z from every number on papers x to y (both inclusive).\nAfter doing this, Bob challenges Alice to tell him the range of this data,\nwhere range denotes the count of numbers from the smallest number to the largest (See here for more details).\nYour task is to help Alice in finding the range.\nInput:\nFirst line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case starts with a line containing two space separated integers N and M.\nThen follow M lines. Each of these lines is of the form w x y z. Each separated by a single space.\nOutput:\nFor each test case output a single line containing the range of the new data set after Bob's modifications.\n\nConstraints:\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 20\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 x \xe2\x89\xa4 y \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 z \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n10 2\n2 3 6 4\n1 5 9 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nExplanation\nInitially the papers are as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. First operation decreases the numbers on paper number 3,4,5 and 6 by 4. Now, the papers look like: 1 2 -1 0 1 2 7 8 9 10. The second operation increases the numbers on papers 5 to 9 by 1. The numbers will now be 1 2 -1 0 2 3 8 9 10 10. Thus, the range is 10 - (-1) = 11.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nvamsi_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85laycurse\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DRANGE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Coordinate Compression, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Pre processing, Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1880\n\n\nDate Added:\n1-07-2012\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.243728 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
