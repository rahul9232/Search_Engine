b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are NN employees (numbered 11 through NN) working at ShareChat. You are given M pairs of employees that do not get along with each other.\nArya, the CEO of ShareChat, wants to throw a party. She is still not sure which employees to invite, but her assistant has given her Q suggestions. Each suggestion consists of K intervals [L1,R1],[L2,R2],\xe2\x80\xa6,[LK,RK]; this means that all employees whose numbers lie in the union of these intervals should be invited to the party.\nArya is a perfectionist, so she wants all invited employees to get along. You, her second assistant, are the only one she could trust with finding out, for each suggestion, if this condition is satisfied. Complete this task!\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nEach of the following M lines contains two space-separated integers u and v indicating that employees u and v do not get along.\nThe next line contains a single integer Q.\nThe following Q lines describe suggestions. Each of these lines contains an integer K, followed by a space and 2K space-separated integers L1,R1,L2,R2,\xe2\x80\xa6,LK,RK.\n\nOutput\nFor each suggestion, print a single line containing the string "YES" if all invited employees get along or "NO" otherwise. \nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,Q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nu\xe2\x89\xa0v\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x89\xa4Ri\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\n[L1,R1],[L2,R2],\xe2\x80\xa6,[LK,RK] are pairwise disjoint\nthe sum of K over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of M over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n2\n1 2 2\n2 3 3 1 1\n4 2\n1 4\n1 4\n2\n2 1 1 2 3\n2 1 2 3 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85watcher\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PARRTY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Segment Trees, Implementation, Range Queries\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Algorithms, Queries\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2510\n\n\nDate Added:\n31-12-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
