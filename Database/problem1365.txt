b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Bengali as well.\nYou are given an array of NN integers. Find the minimum number of integers you need to delete from the array such that the absolute difference between each pair of integers in the remaining array will become equal.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NN.\nThe second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the minimum number of integers to be deleted to satisfy the given condition.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n1 2\n5\n2 5 1 2 2\n4\n1 2 1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n2\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 11: There is only one pair of integers and the absolute difference between them is |A1\xe2\x88\x92A2|=|1\xe2\x88\x922|=1|A1\xe2\x88\x92A2|=|1\xe2\x88\x922|=1. So there is no need to delete any integer from the given array.\nTest case 22: If the integers 11 and 55 are deleted, the array A becomes [2,2,2][2,2,2] and the absolute difference between each pair of integers is 00. There is no possible way to delete less than two integers to satisfy the given condition.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85soumyadeep_21\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EQDIFFER\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Maps, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1500\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-07-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
