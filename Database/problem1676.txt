Currently (at time T=0T=0), there are MM people waiting in the queue. You also know that there are NN more people coming; let's denote the time when the i-th person stands at the back of the queue by Ai. You noticed that each exactly L seconds, one place in the restaurant will become vacant and the person currently at the front of the queue takes it, i.e. at time T=L, one person enters, then at time T=2L, another person enters and so on.\nYou do not like to wait in queues, so you want to choose the time when you stand at the back of the queue in such a way that the time between this moment and the moment when you enter the restaurant is minimum possible. Assume that if you decide to stand at the back of the queue at the same moment as some other person, you will stand before them in the queue (closer to the restaurant). Also, you have to stand at the back of the queue no later than in the K-th second, otherwise you will arrive at home late.\nWhat is the minimum time you have to spend standing in the queue?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers N, M, K and L.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum required time.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4104\n2\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x88\x921 for each valid i\nall elements of A are distinct\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4103\n2\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4104\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 104\n\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints \nExample Input\n4\n6 5 19 3\n4 8 16 12 14 18\n1 10 20 3\n3\n5 2 6 10\n1 2 5 3 4\n1 1 9 5\n8\n\nExample Output\n12\n16\n29\n2\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The best time to enter the queue is T=12.\nExample case 2: The best time to enter the queue is T=20.\nExample case 3: The best time to enter the queue is T=1.\nExample case 4: The best time to enter the queue is T=8.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/QUEUE2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, ad-hoc, Sorting, Observation, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-10-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
