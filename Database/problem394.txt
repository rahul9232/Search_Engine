b"\n\xc2\xa0\n\xef\xbb\xbfChef wanted to spend some time alone, he decided to visit a nearby graveyard. What chef was not aware about was that it was a full moon night. The night was cloudy. At one moment, when he was at the graveyard, the clouds started clearing out and the moon had shown its face, what happened next might scare you. Zombies started come out of their graves and started approaching chef from all sides, he was surrounded.\nThere were N zombies in the graveyard, the ith zombie was di distance away. If any zombie is able to reach chef, the chef dies. The zombies took one second to move one unit. Chef was once a soldier, he keeps a pistol with him all the time, and suppose chef has infinite number of bullets with him.\nChef can only kill one zombie at a time and it takes one second to shoot one zombie. They need to be shot on their head. Now, as soon as he kills one Zombie, rest of the Zombies move forward by one unit. Assuming, he shot them optimally, your task is to find whether chef would be able to survive. One more thing, chef's gun can fire 6 shots without a reload. It takes him one second to reload and during this time zombies move one unit forward.\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe first line of input contains T, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains N, the number of zombies, and the next line contains N space separated integers, denoting the distance of each zombie from the chef.\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nFor each test case print\xe2\x80\x9cYES\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cNO\xe2\x80\x9d (without the double quotes), whether or not chef will be able to survive.\nConstraints\nShould contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have.
