b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nYou are given two binary strings AA and BB with the same length.\nYou may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): pick a substring of AA with odd length and invert all the bits (change \'0\' to \'1\' or vice versa) at odd positions in this substring. For example, if we choose a substring "01011", we can convert it to "11110" (bits at odd positions are bold).\nDetermine the minimum number of operations required to change the string A to the string B.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single string A.\nThe second line contains a single string B.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of operations required.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4|A|=|B|\xe2\x89\xa4105\nA and B contain only characters \'0\' and \'1\'\nthe sum of |A| over all test cases does not exceed 105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n100001\n110111\n1010\n1010\n000\n111\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n0\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Initially, A is "100001". We choose the substring "000" between the 2-nd and 4-th character and convert it to "101".\nNow A becomes "110101". We choose the string "0" containing only the 5-th character and convert it to "1".\nFinally, A becomes "110111", which is equal to B.\nExample case 2: A and B are initially equal, so there is no need to perform any operation.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85gauranggupta\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FLIP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Greedy, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1538\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-11-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
