b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  , Russian and Vietnamese\nA number is called palindromic if its decimal representation is a palindrome. You are given a range, described by a pair of integers L and R. Find the sum of all palindromic numbers lying in the range [L, R], inclusive of both the extrema.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a pair of space separated integers L and R denoting the range for which you are required to find the sum of the palindromic numbers. \nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the sum of all the palindromic numbers in the given range.\n\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nSubtask 1 (34 points) : 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 L \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 103\nSubtask 2 (66 points) : 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 L \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1 10\n123 150\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n45\n272\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. The palindromic numbers between 1 and 10 are all numbers except the number 10. Their sum is 45.\nExample case 2. The palindromic numbers between 123 and 150 are 131 and 141 and their sum is 272.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nsergey_adm\n\n\nTester:\n2\xe2\x98\x85logic_iu\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SPALNUM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, ltime28, palindrome, sergey_adm, simple\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1230\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-08-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
