b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThe droid R2-D2 is travelling in space with a special mission. In space, there are NN planets (numbered 11 through NN) and M bidirectional space highways. Each space highway connects two planets and in order to use it, R2-D2 needs to have a sufficiently high status level.\nThe droid\xe2\x80\x99s mission consists of Q stages. In each stage, there are two planets x and y such that the droid should start the stage at planet x with some initial status level L (L\xe2\x89\xa50) and travel to planet y. For each valid i, when R2-D2 is at planet i (including the initial planet x), he may increase his status level by Ai; it is not allowed to increase the status level multiple times on the same planet in the same stage. Find the minimum value of L such that it is possible for R2-D2 to reach planet y or determine that it is impossible to reach planet y for any L.\nNote that the level R2-D2 has at the end of each stage is not carried over to the next stages (he may start the next stage with a lower initial status level).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nEach of the following M lines contains three space separated integers U, V and W denoting that there is a space highway between planets U and V and R2-D2 may use this highway only if his status level is at least W.\nThe next line contains a single integer Q.\nThe following Q lines describe stages. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers x and y.\n\nOutput\nFor each stage, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum status level required to complete the stage, or \xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to complete this stage.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n0\xe2\x89\xa4W\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V,x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 400,000\nthe sum of M over all test cases does not exceed 400,000\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 400,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (12 points):\n\nN,Q\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nM\xe2\x89\xa41,200\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 4,000\nthe sum of M over all test cases does not exceed 4,000\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 4,000\n\nSubtask #2 (28 points): Ai=0 for each valid i\nSubtask #3 (60 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6 5\n1 3 1 2 0 0\n1 2 4\n1 3 2\n1 4 3\n3 4 5\n3 5 7\n4\n2 2\n1 5\n5 1\n3 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n7\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the second stage, R2-D2 can travel through planets 1\xe2\x86\x923\xe2\x86\x921\xe2\x86\x924\xe2\x86\x921\xe2\x86\x922\xe2\x86\x921\xe2\x86\x923\xe2\x86\x925.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85farhod_farmon\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/R2D2\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, Disjoint Set Union, DFS Order, Prim's Algorithm, Binary lifting, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Advanced Data Structures, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals, Tree Algos, Lowest Common Ancestor, DFS, Minimum Spanning Trees\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3139\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-04-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n4 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
