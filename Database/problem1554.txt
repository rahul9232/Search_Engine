b'\nConcerned with the fitness levels of the players in the National Team, the coach decides to carry out a running drill in the next training session. So, he sets up checkpoints in the training ground at different positions. \nAfter evaluating each player\xe2\x80\x99s fitness, the coach asks each player to cover a certain minimum distance while completing all checkpoints (Suppose a players starts at checkpoint 2, then he must cover all checkpoints and finish at checkpoint 2).\nPlayers being lazy want to finish the drill in exact distance that the coach assigns them. Is it possible?\nInput\nInput description.\n\nFirst line with two space separated integers N and L , the number of checkpoints and the minimum distance that coach asks the player to cover, respectively\nThen N lines containing N space separated integers each. The jth integer on the ith line, dij, denotes the distance between checkpoint point i and j (dij for i != j, and dii = 0).
