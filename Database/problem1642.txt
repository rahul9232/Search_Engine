b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nChef has a sequence of positive integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. He wants to choose some elements of this sequence (possibly none or all of them) and compute their MEX, i.e. the smallest positive integer which does not occur among the chosen elements. For example, the MEX of [1,2,4] is 3.\nHelp Chef find the largest number of elements of the sequence A which he can choose such that their MEX is equal to M, or determine that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum number of elements Chef can choose, or \xe2\x88\x921 if he cannot choose elements in such a way that their MEX is M.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 3\n1 2 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The MEX of whole array is 3.
