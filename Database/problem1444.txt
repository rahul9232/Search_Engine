b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\n\nOnce Chef decided to divide the tangerine into several parts. At first, he numbered tangerine\'s segments from 1 to n in the clockwise order starting from some segment. Then he intended to divide the fruit into several parts. In order to do it he planned to separate the neighbouring segments in k places, so that he could get k parts: the 1st - from segment l1 to segment r1 (inclusive), the 2nd - from l2 to r2, ..., the kth - from lk to rk (in all cases in the clockwise order). Suddenly, when Chef was absent, one naughty boy came and divided the tangerine into p parts (also by separating the neighbouring segments one from another): the 1st - from segment a1 to segment b1, the 2nd - from a2 to b2, ..., the pth - from ap to bp (in all cases in the clockwise order). Chef became very angry about it! But maybe little boy haven\'t done anything wrong, maybe everything is OK? Please, help Chef to determine whether he is able to obtain the parts he wanted to have (in order to do it he can divide p current parts, but, of course, he can\'t join several parts into one).\n Please, note that parts are not cyclic. That means that even if the tangerine division consists of only one part, but that part include more than one segment, there are two segments which were neighbouring in the initial tangerine but are not neighbouring in the division. See the explanation of example case 2 to ensure you understood that clarification.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space separated integers n, k, p, denoting the number of tangerine\'s segments and number of parts in each of the two divisions. The next k lines contain pairs of space-separated integers li and ri. The next p lines contain pairs of space-separated integers ai and bi.\n\nIt is guaranteed that each tangerine\'s segment is contained in exactly one of the first k parts and in exactly one of the next p parts.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing either "Yes" or "No" (without the quotes), denoting whether Chef is able to obtain the parts he wanted to have.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 5 * 107\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 min(500, n)\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 p \xe2\x89\xa4 min(500, n)\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 li, ri, ai, bi \xe2\x89\xa4 n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n10 3 2\n1 4\n5 5\n6 10\n1 5\n6 10\n10 3 1\n2 5\n10 1\n6 9\n1 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYes\nNo\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: To achieve his goal Chef should divide the first part (1-5) in two by separating segments 4 and 5 one from another.\nExample case 2: The boy didn\'t left the tangerine as it was (though you may thought that way), he separated segments 1 and 10 one from another. But segments 1 and 10 are in one part in Chef\'s division, so he is unable to achieve his goal.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85malinovsky239\n\n\nTester:\n2\xe2\x98\x85shiplu\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TANGDIV\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sets, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1840\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-02-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.180108 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
