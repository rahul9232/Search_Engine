Let's define playing a game with two parameters (x,y), where 0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4N, as the following recursive process:\n\nIf x=0, the game ends immediately.\nOtherwise, if y\xe2\x89\xa4lx or rx\xe2\x89\xa4y, end this game and play a game with (x\xe2\x88\x921,y).\nOtherwise (if lx<y<rx), you must choose one of the following options:\nPay A coins, end this game and play a game with (x\xe2\x88\x921,y).\nPay B coins, end this game and play two independent games \xe2\x80\x94 a game with (x\xe2\x88\x921,lx) and a game with (x\xe2\x88\x921,rx).\n\nYou should answer Q independent queries. In each query, you are given two integers x and y and you should start by playing a game with parameters (x,y). Your goal is to reach a state when you should not play any games, since you have successfully ended every game you should have played. Find the minimum number of coins required for reaching this state.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers N, Q, A and B.\nFor each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the i-th of the next N lines contains two space-separated integers li and ri.\nQ lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers x and y describing a query.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of coins.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (40 points): Q,N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85103\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85103\n\nSubtask #2 (60 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4 3 3 4\n3 5\n3 5\n1 3\n2 5\n4 4\n4 5\n1 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n7\n0\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: One of the strategies that use the minimum number of coins is:\n\nPay 3 coins and play a game with (3,4).\nIn the game with (3,4), you just play a game with (2,4), since 4 is outside the 3-rd segment.\nIn the game with (2,4), pay 4 coins and play games with (1,3) and (1,5).\nBoth of these games end without paying any more coins. The only thing left is playing games with (0,3) and (0,5), which end immediately, also without paying any coins.\n\nThe total number of coins used in this strategy is 7.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85farhod_farmon\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BOFS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Lazy Propagation, Sorting\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Segment Trees, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2914\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-06-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
