b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nYou are given an array aa of length NN and QQ queries. Each query is described by a pair of integers, l and r. Answer each query with the following: if we take every subsequence of the elements with indices between l and r (inclusive) and write down their products, what will be the smallest missing positive integer?\nA subsequence of an array is a sequence you obtain by deleting some (possibly zero or all) elements of the array. The product of the empty subsequence is defined to be 1.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN.\nEach of the next Q lines contains two space-separated integers, l and r, denoting the query's range.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, output the smallest missing subsequence product on a new line.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5 3\n2 3 2 5 4\n2 3\n1 4\n3 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n7\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nThe array is [2,3,2,5,4].\nThe first query asks about the range [2,3]. The subsequences of this range are [], [3], [2], and [3,2]. They have products 1, 3, 2, and 6, respectively. The smallest missing positive integer from the list of products is 4.\nThe second query asks about the range [1,4].\n\n[] has product 1\n[2] has product 2\n[3] has product 3\n[2,2] has product 4\n[5] has product 5\n[2,3] has product 6\nBut 7 does not appear as a subsequence product in the given range.\n\nThe third query asks about the range [3,5].\n\n[] has product 1\n[2] has product 2\nBut 3 does not appear as a subsequence product in the given range.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mohammed200218\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PRODMEX\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Sets, Segment Trees, Prime Divisors, Binary Search\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Mathematics, Number Theory, Integer Factorisation, Divisors, Algorithms, Searching\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3183\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-05-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
