b'\nRead problems statements in mandarin chinese, russian and vietnamese as well.\n\nChef Ada loves trees, she thinks that the beauty of a tree is determined by the distance between its center and centroid. If the tree has multiple centers or centroids, then the beauty is the maximum among every possible pair.\n\n\nAs a reward for her delicious dishes (and awesome coding skills), CodeChef is going to give a present to Chef Ada, and of course it must be a tree! But not any tree, we want to give her one with n nodes, and beauty b. Help find such a tree.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains one number T, the number of test cases.\n\n\nEach test case contains two integers n and b, the desired number of vertices and beauty.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, if no tree satisfies the conditions print "NO" in a new line.\n\n\nOtherwise, print "YES" in a new line and describe any valid tree. Print n-1 more lines, each with two integers ui, vi (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ui, vi \xe2\x89\xa4 n) denoting the indices of the vertices connected by an edge in the tree.\n\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 104\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 b \xe2\x89\xa4 n-1\nNotes\n\nA vertex u is a centroid if after removing u from the tree, the size of any of the resulting connected components is at most n/2.\n\n\nLef f(x) be the greatest distance from u to any other vertex of the tree. A vertex u is a center if f(u) \xe2\x89\xa4 f(v)  for any other vertex v.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4 0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n\n\nExplanation\n\nVertex 1 is the center and centroid of the tree.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85alei\n\n\nTester:\n3\xe2\x98\x85deadwing97\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CENTREE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Graph Algos, Constructive\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2319\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-05-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
