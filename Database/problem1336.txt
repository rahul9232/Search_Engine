He thinks that MM would be delicious if:\n\nEach element of this matrix is an integer between 11 and N2N2 inclusive.\nAll the elements of the matrix are pairwise distinct.\nFor each square submatrix containing cells in rows rr through r+ar+a and in columns cc through c+ac+a (inclusive) for some valid integers rr, cc and a\xe2\x89\xa50a\xe2\x89\xa50:\nMr,c+Mr+a,c+aMr,c+Mr+a,c+a is even\nMr,c+a+Mr+a,cMr,c+a+Mr+a,c is even\n\nCan you help Chef generate a delicious matrix? It can be proved that a solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print NN lines describing a delicious matrix MM. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines should contain NN space-separated integers Mi,1,Mi,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Mi,NMi,1,Mi,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Mi,N.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\nthe sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 103103\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1 2\n4 3\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The matrix MM has five square submatrices. Four of them ([1][1], [2][2], [4][4], [3][3]) have a=0a=0, so they obviously satisfy all conditions. The last square submatrix is the whole matrix MM, with r=c=a=1r=c=a=1, and we can see that M1,1+M2,2=1+3=4M1,1+M2,2=1+3=4 and M1,2+M2,1=2+4=6M1,2+M2,1=2+4=6 are both even.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85vitz_6\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/EVENM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 2D Arrays\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1376\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-01-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
