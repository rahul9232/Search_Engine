He helps people out by telling them whether their current partner is their true soulmate based on their partner\'s Horoscope Matrix. Bhavyesh is busy with his own partner today, so he has asked you to fill in for him.\nA Horoscope Matrix is said to be good if each of its diagonals directed from the top left to the bottom right contains only equal elements, i.e. the same value repeated one or more times. This value may be different for different diagonals.\nYou are given a Horoscope Matrix with NN rows (numbered 11 through NN) and M columns (numbered 1 through M). For each valid i and j, let\'s denote the element in the i-th row and j-th column by Ai,j.\nYou should process Q queries. In each query:\n\nYou are given three integers X, Y and V. Change the value of AX,Y to V.\nThen, determine if the current Horoscope Matrix is good.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M. \nN lines follow. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the i-th of these lines contains M space-separated integers Ai,1,Ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ai,M describing the initial matrix.\nThe next line contains a single integer Q.\nEach of the next Q lines contains three space-separated integers X, Y and V describing a query.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing the string "Yes" if the matrix is good or "No" if it is not good (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4500\n|Ai,j|\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i,j\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Y\xe2\x89\xa4M\n|V|\xe2\x89\xa4109\nthe sum of N\xe2\x8b\x85M over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\nT\xe2\x89\xa450\nN,M\xe2\x89\xa4100\nQ=1\n\nSubtask #2 (30 points):\n\nT\xe2\x89\xa450\nN,M,Q\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\nSubtask #3 (60 points): original constraints \nExample Input\n1\n2 3\n1 4 3\n7 1 4\n3\n1 2 4\n1 1 5\n2 2 5\n\nExample Output\nYes\nNo\nYes\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The first query does not change the Horoscope Matrix. After this query, the matrix is good because all diagonals contain only equal elements (in the order from the top right diagonal to the bottom left diagonal, they are 3, 4, 1 and 7).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85nikhil_medam\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/HRSCPMTR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 2D Arrays, Multiset, Hashmaps, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Sets, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
