b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nRJ is a very curious observer. On the first day of every month, he tries to figure out, for each of the seven days of the week, how many times that day occurs in the current month.\nRJ got confused so badly doing this that he asks for your help!\nHe asks several queries; in each query, he gives you the number of days in the current month and which day of the week is on the 1st of the current month.\nFor each query, you should tell him how many times each day of the week occurs.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains an integer W and a string S, separated by a space.\nW denotes the number of days in the current month.\nS is one of the strings "mon", "tues", "wed", "thurs", "fri", "sat" or "sun", denoting the day of the week on the 1st of the current month.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print seven space-separated integers denoting the number of occurrences of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 103\n28 \xe2\x89\xa4 W \xe2\x89\xa4 31\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (20 points): W = 28\n\n\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n28 mon\n31 wed\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n4 4 5 5 5 4 4\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85abx_2109\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/NW1\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, Brute Force\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1228\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-10-2017\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
