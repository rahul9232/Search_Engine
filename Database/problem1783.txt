b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nYou are given a tree of NN nodes rooted at node 11. Each node u initially has a positive value au associated with it.\nYou randomly choose one node in the tree and change its value to zero. If any node u has a value equal to 0, a random node v will be chosen in the subtree of u (u\xe2\x89\xa0v), and the values au and av will be swapped, hence the value of the node v will become zero and the process will continue until the zero is on a leaf node. At this point, we will call the tree a final tree.\nNote: there is exactly one node with a value equal to zero in a final tree and that node is a leaf node.\nYour task is to tell how many different final trees are possible. Two final trees are different if there exists at least one node u, such that the value of the node u in one final tree differs from the value of the node u in the other final tree. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N, the number of nodes.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two integers u and v, denoting that there is an undirected edge between the node u and the node v.\nThe next line contains N integers a1,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output on a new line, number of different final trees possible, modulo 109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\nThe edges form a tree structure.\nThe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106.\n\nSample Input\n3\n1\n1\n4\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n1 1 1 2\n7\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 6\n3 7\n1 2 3 4 1 2 1\n\nSample Output\n1\n4\n14\n\nExplanation\n\nFor the first test case, the only possible final tree is when node 1 is chosen and its value becomes 0.\nFor the second test case, the four possible final trees are:\n\n[ 1, 1, 1, 0 ]\n[ 1, 1, 0, 2 ]\n[ 1, 2, 1, 0 ]\n[ 2, 1, 1, 0 ]\n( The i-th number in the array denotes the value of node i in the final tree).\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85mexomerf\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FLGZRO\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 DSU on Trees, Combinatorics, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Mathematics, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2834\n\n\nDate Added:\n8-05-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
