b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nChef sometimes suffers from insomnia. During sleepless nights, he often plays this game: He creates an array A of N integers and also decides one integer K. After that, he tries to count the number of non-empty contiguous subsequences (subsegments) of A, such that there are no bad pairs of integers in this subsegment. A pair (x, y) of integers is called bad if x is situated to the left of y in the array and x mod y = K. Finally, before going to sleep, Chef wrote down the answer on a sheet of paper. Sadly, he has forgotten it this morning and want your help regarding that.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers - N and K.\nSecond line contains N integers - A1, A2 ... AN - separated by spaces, denoting the array A.\n\nOutput\nA single line containing an integer - the answer to the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 105 \n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 105 \n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1: N \xe2\x89\xa4 100 (15 points) \nSubtask 2: N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000 (15 points) \nSubtask 3: K = 0 (10 points) \nSubtask 4: Original constraints (60 points) \n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3 2\n5 3 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85zedthirtyeight\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85laycurse\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHINSM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Divisors, ad-hoc, Range Minimum Queries\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Number Theory, Integer Factorisation, Algorithms, Constructive, Queries\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2197\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-07-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
