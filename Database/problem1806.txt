b'\nRead problems statements Bengali , Mandarin chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nThere is a programming contest held by ShareChat. According to the contest rules, submissions do not receive any feedback until the end of the contest. The judges wanted to benefit from this fact to make their favourite contestants win the contest.\nIn one of the problems, there were a total of N submissions (numbered 1 through N) received. The judges prepared a total of M tests (numbered 1 through M) for this problem. For each submission i and each test j, we know that the time this submission ran on this test is Ai,j and whether it produced a correct answer or not.\nThe judges can still decide the time limit for this problem. For each submission, they have decided whether they wanted it to pass all the tests or not. You are given an integer sequence D1,D2,\xe2\x80\xa6,DN; Di=1 denotes that submission i should pass all tests and Di=0 denotes that it should fail on at least one test, either by exceeding the time limit (getting TLE) or producing an incorrect answer (getting WA).\nNow, the judges want to decide the time limit of the problem and the subset of tests they should use so that each submission gets the desired verdict (passes or fails).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M. \nThe second line contains N space-separated integers D1,D2,\xe2\x80\xa6,DN.\nN lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains M space-separated integers Ai,1,Ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ai,M.\nN more lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains M space-separated integers Bi,1,Bi,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Bi,M. Here, Bi,j=1 denotes that submission i produced a correct answer on test j and Bi,j=0 denotes that it did not.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a line containing the string "NO" if it is impossible to find a solution or "YES" otherwise. If a solution exists, print two more lines. The first of these lines should contain two space-separated integers T (the time limit, 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4109) and K (the number of tests chosen). The last line should contain K space-separated integers denoting the indices of the chosen tests.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nthe sum of N for all test cases does not exceed 1,000\nthe sum of M for all test cases does not exceed 1,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,j\xe2\x89\xa4108 for each valid i,j\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa415\nM\xe2\x89\xa415\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\nExample Input\n2\n3 4\n1 1 1\n5 7 4 10\n7 4 7 20\n1 6 3 7\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n2 2\n1 0\n7 8\n4 5\n1 0\n1 0\n\nExample Output\nYES\n10 2\n2 3\nNO\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BJUDGE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Constructive, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2739\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-09-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
