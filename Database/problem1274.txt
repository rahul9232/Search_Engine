b'\nYou are provided with a weighted undirected graph GG and string SS. Each node in G has a letter attached to it. Find the minimum cost of a walk in G such that the path contains S as a subsequence i.e. S can be formed by removing 0 or more characters from the string formed by the concatenation of letters on the nodes on the walk.\nYou are allowed to begin as well as end your walk at any vertex. Also, you can visit any vertex any number of times.\nInput:\n\nFirst line contains integer T, representing number of test cases. Each test case is as follows.\nThe first line contains integers N and M and X - Number of nodes and edges  and the length of string respectively.\nThe second line contains string S.\nThe third line contains N characters. ith character represents the letter attached to the ith node.\nFollowing M lines contain u\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0w. This means u and v are connected by an edge weight w.\n\nOutput:\nOutput a single integer that represents the minimum cost of the path that contains S as a sub-sequence.\nIf there is no path that contains S as a sub-sequence then output -1.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa43\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,X\xe2\x89\xa41000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41e3\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n0\xe2\x89\xa4w\xe2\x89\xa41000\nNo two consecutive characters of string S are same.\n\nSubtasks\n\n30 points : N, M and X \xe2\x89\xa4100 \n70 points : Original constraints.\n\nSample Input:\n1\n4 4 5\nababc\na b b c\n1 2 2\n1 3 1\n2 4 3\n3 4 1               \nSample Output:\n4\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe path will be:\n1 - 3 - 1 - 3 - 4\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85rishik123\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/STRGRA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 akashbhalotia, dijkstra-algorithm, greedy, ico, icop1904, medium, rishik123\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-01-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, PYPY\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
