b"\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nChef played an interesting game yesterday. This game is played with two variables XX and YY; initially, X=Y=0X=Y=0. Chef may make an arbitrary number of moves (including zero). In each move, he must perform the following process:\n\nChoose any positive integer P such that P\xe2\x8b\x85P>Y.\nChange X to P.\nAdd P\xe2\x8b\x85P to Y.\n\nUnfortunately, Chef has a bad memory and he has forgotten the moves he made. He only remembers the value of X after the game finished; let's denote it by Xf. Can you tell him the maximum possible number of moves he could have made in the game?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer Xf.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of moves Chef could have made.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Xf\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n8\n9\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5\n6\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 2: One possible sequence of values of X is 0\xe2\x86\x921\xe2\x86\x922\xe2\x86\x923\xe2\x86\x925\xe2\x86\x928.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85imanik\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TWOVRIBL\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1973\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-07-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
