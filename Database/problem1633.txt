b'\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given two binary strings SS and PP, each with length N. A binary string contains only characters \'0\' and \'1\'. For each valid i, let\'s denote the i-th character of S by Si.\nYou have to convert the string S into P using zero or more operations. In one operation, you should choose two indices i and j (1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4N) such that Si is \'1\' and Sj is \'0\', and swap Si with Sj.\nDetermine if it is possible to convert S into P by performing some operations.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains a single string S.\nThe third line contains a single string P.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "Yes" if it is possible to convert S into P or "No" otherwise (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nS and P contain only characters \'0\' and \'1\'\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa414\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 100\n\nSubtask #2 (30 points): the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 1,000\nSubtask #3 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n00\n00\n3\n101\n010\n4\n0110\n0011\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYes\nNo\nYes\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The strings are already equal.\nExample case 2: It can be showed that it is impossible to convert S into P.\nExample case 3: You can swap S2 with S4.
