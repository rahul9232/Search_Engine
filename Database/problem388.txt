b'\nSherlock has made a N\xc3\x97NN\xc3\x97N (Numbered 11 through NN) square matrix on the floor with a colored pencil. Cell(i,j)(i,j) denotes the Cell at row ii and column jj. And he has exactly N2N2 toffees having price PP on it. He keeps all the toffees randomly on each cell. You can start from any Cell(i,j)(i,j) and can only move to the Cell(i+1,j+1)(i+1,j+1) or Cell(i\xe2\x88\x921,j\xe2\x88\x921)(i\xe2\x88\x921,j\xe2\x88\x921) and you can visit the Cells as long as a Cell lies within the boundary of the matrix and the cells which are not been visited yet. You need to maximize the total price SS by picking the toffees from the cells as per the given condition.\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains the integer NN. Followed by NN lines and each line contains NN space-separated NN integers i.e. P(i,j)P(i,j). \n\n\nOutput:\n\nPrint a single line containing the integer SS \xe2\x80\x93 The maximized total price of toffees.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n0\xe2\x89\xa4P(i,j)\xe2\x89\xa41060\xe2\x89\xa4P(i,j)\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\n\nSample Input 1:\n    2\n    1 2\n    4 5\n\nSample Output 1:\n    6\n\n\nSample Input 2:\n    4\n    0 0 3 0\n    2 3 10 5\n    1 0 0 1\n    0 1 6 1\n\nSample Output 2:\n    11\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nSample case 1: The moves you can follow are (1,1)(1,1)->(2,2)(2,2).\nSample case 2: The moves you can follow are (2,3)(2,3)->(3,4)(3,4).\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85dharnendra23\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SHERMAT1\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 dharnendra23, easy, math, nyre2020\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-12-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
