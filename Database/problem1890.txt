On the other hand, Ghoda found out that he can only swap elements of his permutation.\nThe distance between two permutations P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN and R1,R2,\xe2\x80\xa6,RN is the sum of |i\xe2\x88\x92j| over all pairs of valid indices i,j such that Pi=Rj.\nYou should process Q queries. In each query, one of Saeed's grandsons plays with his permutation (performs an operation described above), and afterwards, you should tell Saeed the distance between his grandsons' current permutations. Note that the queries are cumulative \xe2\x80\x94 the changes made in one query remain in subsequent queries.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN, denoting Rami's initial permutation.\nThe third line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN, denoting Ghoda's initial permutation.\nEach of the next Q lines describes a query in one of the following formats:\n1 z: Rami moves z elements from the beginning of his permutation to the end.\n2 x y: Ghoda swaps the x-th and y-th element of his permutation.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the current distance between the permutations.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N\nx\xe2\x89\xa0y\n1\xe2\x89\xa4z\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x921\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,Bi\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\nA and B are permutations\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4 3\n1 3 2 4\n4 3 2 1\n1 1\n2 3 1\n1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2\n8\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nRami's permutation is (1,3,2,4)\xe2\x86\x92(3,2,4,1)\xe2\x86\x92(3,2,4,1)\xe2\x86\x92(4,1,3,2).\nGhoda's permutation is (4,3,2,1)\xe2\x86\x92(4,3,2,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,3,4,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,3,4,1).\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85i_love_islam\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MAGPER\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Segment Trees, Lazy Propagation\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3097\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-08-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
