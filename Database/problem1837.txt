She invented a very cool hair style and named it "power tree".\nA power tree with degree l \xe2\x80\x94 let\'s denote it by PT(l) \xe2\x80\x94 is a directed graph, which can be constructed recursively as follows:\n\nPT(0) consists of a single node.\nFor l>0:\nCreate one node u \xe2\x80\x94 the root of power tree PT(l).\nConstruct all power trees with smaller degrees, i.e. PT(0),PT(1),\xe2\x80\xa6,PT(l\xe2\x88\x921).\nFor each of the tree created in the previous step, add a directed edge from u to its root.\n\nToday, Ada is going to cut the hair of some customers. Of course, all of them want to have a power tree hair style!\nA customer\'s uncut hair is represented by a directed graph with N vertices (numbered 1 through N) and exactly one edge between each pair of vertices. Ada should remove some edges (possibly none) from this graph in such a way that the resulting graph is a power tree. Note that she is not allowed to remove vertices!\nCan you help Ada find the edges she should remove?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nEach of the next (N2) lines contains two space-separated integers u and v describing a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v. The edges are numbered 1 through (N2) in this order.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf it is impossible to create a power tree, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x88\x921.\nOtherwise, print two lines. The first of these lines should contain a single integer e denoting the number of edges to remove. The second line should contain e space-separated integers denoting the numbers of the edges to remove.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, you may print any one.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4128\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4256\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthere is exactly one edge between each pair of vertices\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4\n1 4\n2 1\n2 4\n3 1\n3 2\n3 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1 3 4\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Ada should remove edges (1,4), (2,4) and (3,1).
