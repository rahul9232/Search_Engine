For each valid i, the i-th road connects provinces Ui and Vi. It is possible to travel from each province to any other province using these roads.\nFor each valid i, the annual income of the i-th province is Ai and its population is Bi. The per-capita income of some provinces is lower than that of some other provinces. For this reason, the king of Chefland wants to choose one or more provinces to keep in his kingdom and abandon the rest, in such a way that the per-capita income of the whole resulting kingdom, i.e. the sum of annual incomes of the chosen provinces divided by the sum of their populations, would be maximum possible. However, it should also be possible to travel from each of the chosen provinces to any other chosen province without visiting any of the abandoned provinces. Among all such ways to form the new kingdom, the king would prefer the number of chosen provinces to be as large as possible.\nCan you help the king choose which provinces should form the new kingdom? If there are multiple solutions that maximise the per-capita income, you should choose one with the maximum number of chosen provinces. If there are still multiple solutions, you may choose any one.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nThe third line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN.\nM lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Ui and Vi.\n\nOutput\nPrint two lines.\n\nThe first of these lines should contain a single integer K denoting the number of provinces the king should choose.\nThe second line should contain K space-separated integers denoting these provinces.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ui,Vi\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\nUi\xe2\x89\xa0Vi for each valid i\nthere is at most one road between each pair of provinces\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 3\n10 1 2\n5 1 1 \n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1 3\n\n\nExplanation\nIf the king chooses provinces 1 and 3, then the per-capita income is 10+25+1=2. This is the only optimal solution.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85rezwanarefin01\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PERCAPTA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Graphs, Basic Maths, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Mathematics, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2132\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
