b'\n\nIt is time of i.fest\'16 and deadline is till 2 am for girls. Last night one newly formed couple (Mr.X and Miss.Y)\nwas going on CR. Seeing this Mr.Z who has a big crush on Miss Y since first year, wants to follow them and see what \nthey are doing this late.So assuming CR as a circular track of radius r. Both the couple and Mr.Z starts from canteen.\nThey start either in same direction or in the opposite direction, indefinitely (for infinite time).\n\nThe speed of both of them is given to you with radius of circle.\nSpeed will be positive in clockwise(HoR-Women) direction, and negative in anticlockwise(HoR-Men) direction. \nPrint the number of distinct points, at which they will meet on the circle.\n\nIf both couple and Mr. Z are travelling with the same speed print "INF" (without inverted comma).\n\nInput\n\nFirst line contains T, number of test cases.\nEach test case contains three space separated integers, r, v1 and v2. \nHere r is the radius of the circular track and v1 and v2 are the velocity of couple and Mr. Z respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print an integer on new line denoting the number of distinct point that they would meet during \nCR which is going on for indefinite time. \n\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <= 100000\n1 <= r <= 1000000\n-1012 <= v1,v2 <= 1012\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n2 1\n4 2 \n\nOutput:\n1 \n1\n\nExplanation\n\nSelf Explanatory :-)\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85black_well\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/REL205\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 black_well, hard, irly1601, math\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-10-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
