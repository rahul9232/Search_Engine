In this competition, there are NN squares (numbered 11 through NN) in a row. Chef must choose a starting square, enter this square and start jumping on his pogo stick. In each jump, if Chef is at a square s, then he can only jump to the square s+K. If square s+K does not exist, Chef jumps out of the row of squares and the race ends for him. It is not allowed to stop jumping any earlier.\nEach square has a value; let's denote the value of the i-th square by Ai. Initially, Chef has 0 points. When he jumps in some square (including the initial square), he is awarded a number of points equal to the value of this square, exactly once. Note that if this value is negative, the number of Chef's points is decreased.\nDetermine the maximum possible total number of points Chef can get if he selects the initial cell optimally.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum number of points.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4105\n|Ai|\xe2\x89\xa410,000 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 10,000\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5 2\n3 6 4 7 2\n5 3\n3 -5 6 3 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n13\n10\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/POGOSTCK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 1D Arrays, Dynamic Programming\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1685\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-03-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
