b'\nRead problems statements Bengali , Mandarin chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nYou have been recently hired as a developer in CodeChef. Your first mission is to implement a feature that will determine the number of submissions that were judged late in a contest.\nThere are NN submissions, numbered 11 through NN. For each valid i, the i-th submission was submitted at time Si and judged at time Ji (in minutes). Submitting and judging both take zero time. Please determine how many submissions received their verdicts after a delay of more than 5 minutes.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer N.\nN lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Si and Ji.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of submissions for which the judging was delayed by more than 5 minutes.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x89\xa4Ji\xe2\x89\xa4300 for each valid i\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n1 3\n4 4\n4 10\n1 11\n2 7\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The delays of the respective submissions are 2 minutes, 0 minutes, 6 minutes, 10 minutes and 5 minutes. Only submissions 3 and 4 are delayed by more than 5 minutes, hence the answer is 2.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/JDELAY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n964\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-09-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
