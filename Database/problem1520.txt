b"\n\nVishwas is suffering from sesquipedalophobia i.e. fear of long words. \nVishwas cannot tolerate a string of length greater than K. So Dhruv gave him a long string (containing only characters a,b and c) of length N to annoy him. You being his friend, came to his rescue.You cannot change the length of the string. So you came up with a plan to change some of the characters of the string such that string repeats after every K characters. In other words, now he has to only memorize only first K characters and write them N / K times to form the whole string.\n\n\nFor example:- abcabcabc is  acceptable for K = 3.\n\n\nAs changing characters is a costly process, so you have to complete the process in minimum number of changes.Now you have to output the first K characters of these newly formed repetitive string. If there are multiple answer print the lexicographically smallest string.\n\nInput\n\n\nThe first line of the input contains a pair of integers N, K. N is always divisible by K\n\n\nThe second line contains the string containing only characters a,b and c.\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nPrint the first K characters which can be formed in minimum number of changes.Also the output should be lexicographically smallest.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K,N \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\nExample\nInput:\nInput #1:\n9 3\nabccbcabc\n\nInput #2:\n4 2\nbacb\n\nOutput:\nOutput #1:\nabc\n\nOuput #2:\nba\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\n\nIn the first case,we can make the string repetitive after K characters by making 1 change. Change the 4th character to 'a'.\nHence the output is abc.\nOther option is to output cbc but it requires 2 changes.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n3\xe2\x98\x85amanmittal\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/INSQ15_D\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, amanmittal, insq2015\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n4-09-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nJAVA, C, CPP14, PYP3\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
