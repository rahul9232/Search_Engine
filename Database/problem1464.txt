Each of them is so small that we can consider them as points on a plane. You are given the Cartesian coordinates of all islands. X-axis is directed towards East and Y-axis is directed towards North.\nYou need to illuminate all the islands. To do this, you can place lighthouses on some of the islands. You can't place more than one lighthouse on any single island. Each lighthouse can light only one of the 4 quadrants: North-Western, North-Eastern, South-Western or South-Eastern. If some island is located on the border of an illuminated quadrant, it is considered to be illuminated as well. Note that this means that a lighthouse always illuminates it's own island as well.\nFind the smallest possible number of lighthouses required to illuminate all the islands (say L). Describe their configurations \xe2\x80\x94 positions and quadrants illuminated \xe2\x80\x94 as well.\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of islands.\nThe ith of the following N lines contains two integers Xi and Yi denoting the coordinates of the ith island.\nOutput\nFor each test case, first line of output must contain minimum number of lighthouses required to illuminate all islands, L.\nFollowing L lines must describe configuration of the lighthouses, one configuration per line. Description of a lighthouse configuration consists of the number of the island where the lighthouse is placed, and the direction of the quadrant (NW for North-Western, NE for North-Eastern, SW for South-Western, SE for South-Eastern) illuminated by it, separated by a single space.\nIf there are many possible placements, output any one of them.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\nThe sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 5*105\nAbsolute value of each coordinate doesn't exceed 109\nNo two given islands coincide.\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1: (15 points)\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 8\nAbsolute value of each coordinate doesn't exceed 50\n\nSubtask 2: (85 points)\nOriginal constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5\n0 0\n1 0\n2 0\n0 -1\n0 -2\n4\n5 0\n-5 0\n0 5\n0 -5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 SW\n2\n4 NE\n2 NE\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Also we can place lighthouse on 1st or 5th island.\nExample case 2. Notice that some islands can be illuminated by more than 1 lighthouse.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85eartemov\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85kevinsogo\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LIGHTHSE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Optimization Problems, Case work, Conditional Statements, Cartesian Coordinate System, ad-hoc, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Basic Programming Concepts, Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1986\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-07-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
