It consists of N nodes numbered from 1 to N in which the people of that world reside. The nodes are organized in a tree structure rooted at node 1. You need to assign values to the nodes according to the wishes of emperor KZS which are as follows :-\n\nThe value of node 1 is X.\nAll immediate children of any node have pairwise distinct values.                                   \nFor every node with at least one immediate child, the gcd of the values of all immediate children is equal to the value of the node.                                                                                                                                           \nThe total sum of the values of all nodes should be minimum.\n\nThe greatest common divisor gcd(a,b) of two positive integers a and b is equal to the largest integer d such that both integers a and b are divisible by d.\nPrint the sum of all values, modulo 109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T testcases follow.  \nThe first line of each test contains two integers N and X.\nEach of the following N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two integers u and v, denoting an edge between nodes u and v.                               \n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print the sum of values, modulo 109+7.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa415 \n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105 \n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4109 \n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N and u\xe2\x89\xa0v \nThe given edges form a tree\nThe sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x85105.          \n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): Original Constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n4 1\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n8 1\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n5 6\n5 7\n7 8\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n7\n11\n\n\nExplanation\nIn test case 1, we will give values 1, 2, 3 to the nodes 2, 3 and 4 respectively.\nSo, the total sum will be 1+1+2+3=7.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85zankanotachi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/THOUSES\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Priority Queue, GCD, DFS\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Queues, Mathematics, Number Theory, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2023\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-04-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
