Find the number of sets P\xe2\x8a\x82{1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N} such that there is a character c and a string X which is equivalent to S and satisfies Xp=c for each p\xe2\x88\x88P. Since the answer may be large, compute it modulo 998,244,353.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string S with length N.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of subsets of characters that can be equal to each other in some string equivalent to S, modulo 998,244,353.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42,000\nS contains only lowercase Latin letters\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa410\nSubtask #2 (90 points): T\xe2\x89\xa410\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\naaa\naba\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8\n5\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nildar_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PALINDEQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 combinatorics, dec20, dynamic-programming, hard, ildar_adm, taran_1407\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2958\n\n\nDate Added:\n30-11-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
