b"\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian\nA squarer is a simple and convenient device. You give it some positive integer X and it calculates its square.\nLeha is implementing a module of this device which is responsible for squaring the numbers consisting of multiple repetitions of one digit. But it turned out that it's not as simple as he thought.\nPlease help him now!\nInput\nThe first line contains one integer T denoting the number of testcases. The descriptions of T test cases follow.\nEach of the following T lines contain 2 space-separated integers - N and D, respectively. It means that the number X in the corresponding testcase consists of the digit D repeated N times (in decimal representation).\nOutput\nAs the answer can be very large, we ask you to output its hash which is computed in the following way:\nLet's consider the integer answer Y as a 0-indexed array starting from its leftmost digit. The hash function is calculated as: p0*Y[0] + p1*Y[1] + ... + pM-1*Y[M-1] modulo 109 + 7 where M is the length of the array representation of Y and p equals 23.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 20\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 D \xe2\x89\xa4 9\nSubtask 1 (16 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 9\nSubtask 2 (25 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nSubtask 3 (27 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 2 \xc3\x97 104\nSubtask 4 (32 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n1 4\n3 6\n3 5\n\nOutput:\n139\n40079781\n32745632\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first test case, X = 4 and Y = 16. Its hash equals 1*1 + 23*6 = 139.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85pavel1996\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85xcwgf666\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FSTSQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 String, Modular Arithmetic, Basic Maths, ad-hoc, Implementation, Prefix Sum, Suffix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2366\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-09-2015\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
