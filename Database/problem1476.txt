b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese\n, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nVanja and Miksi really like games. After playing one game for a long time, they decided to invent another game!\nIn this game, they have a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN and two numbers Z1Z1 and Z2Z2. The rules of the game are as follows:\n\nThe players take turns alternately, starting with Vanja.\nThere is an integer SS; at the beginning, S=0S=0.\nIn each turn, the current player must choose an arbitrary element of AA and either add that number to SS or subtract it from SS. Each element can be selected multiple times.\nAfterwards, if S=Z1S=Z1 or S=Z2S=Z2, the current player (the player who made SS equal to Z1Z1 or Z2Z2) is the winner of the game.\nIf the game lasts for 10101010 turns, Vanja and Miksi decide to declare it a tie.\n\nCan you help the boys determine the winner of the game? Please note that the game can end in a tie (if nobody can make S=Z1S=Z1 or S=Z2S=Z2 in the first 10101010 moves).\nBoth players play optimally, i.e. if there is a move which guarantees the current player's victory regardless of the other player's moves, the current player will make such a move. If the current player cannot win and there is a move which guarantees that the game will end in a tie, the current player will make such a move.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, Z1Z1 and Z2Z2.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the final result of the game:\n11 if Vanja (the first player) has a winning strategy\n22 if Miksi (the second player) has a winning strategy\n00 if the game ends in a tie\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450\n|Z1|,|Z2|\xe2\x89\xa4109|Z1|,|Z2|\xe2\x89\xa4109\n|Ai|\xe2\x89\xa4109|Ai|\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid ii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (25 points): N=2N=2\nSubtask #2 (75 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 6 4\n-4 10\n1 1 -1\n2\n2 0 7\n3 4\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The first player can choose the value A1=\xe2\x88\x924A1=\xe2\x88\x924, subtract it from S=0S=0 and obtain S=\xe2\x88\x92(\xe2\x88\x924)=4=Z2S=\xe2\x88\x92(\xe2\x88\x924)=4=Z2. The winner is the first player.  \nExample case 2: It can be proven that neither player is able to reach S=Z1S=Z1 or S=Z2S=Z2. The result is a tie.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85allllekssssa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/JAGAM\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, allllekssssa, game-theory, ltime63\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2019\n\n\nDate Added:\n24-08-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
