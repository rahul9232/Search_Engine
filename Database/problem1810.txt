b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a grid with N rows (numbered 1 through N) and M columns (numbered 1 through M). Let's denote the cell in row r and column c by (r,c). Two cells of the grid are adjacent if they share a side.\nSome of the cells of this grid contain treasures. You do not know exactly which cells contain them, but an analysis of the grid, called a treasure hunt map, is available. For each cell (i,j), you are given an integer Ai,j with the following meaning:\n\nAi,j=\xe2\x88\x921: no information\nAi,j=0: there is an even number of cells containing a treasure which are adjacent to the cell (i,j)\nAi,j=1: there is an odd number of cells containing a treasure which are adjacent to the cell (i,j)\n\nA treasure layout is the set of all cells containing treasures. Find the number of possible treasure layouts that are consistent with all the given information. Since the answer may be large, compute it modulo 109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nN lines follow. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the i-th of these lines contains M space-separated integers Ai,1,Ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ai,M.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of treasure layouts modulo 109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa430\n|Ai,j|\xe2\x89\xa41 for each valid i,j\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa44\nSubtask #2 (20 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa430\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa44\n\nSubtask #3 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 2\n1 -1 \n1 -1 \n1 0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85ashishgup\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TREASURE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Functional Equations, Gaussian Elimination\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algebra, Matrices\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2484\n\n\nDate Added:\n23-02-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
