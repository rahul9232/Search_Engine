b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef went to the store and saw a long queue. There are N people in the queue (numbered 1 through N from the front of the queue to the back); as it usually happens in such a situation, each person has a certain anger level. Let's denote the anger level of the i-th person by ai.\nChef wants to finish shopping as fast as possible, so he decided to try jumping the queue instead of just standing at its back. However, he cannot make the people already standing in the queue much angrier, since that would not end well for him. Chef may stand in the queue directly in front of person p only if the expression\n\xe2\x8c\x8aap1\xe2\x8c\x8b+\xe2\x8c\x8aap+12\xe2\x8c\x8b+\xe2\x8c\x8aap+23\xe2\x8c\x8b+\xe2\x80\xa6+\xe2\x8c\x8aaNN\xe2\x88\x92p+1\xe2\x8c\x8b\ndoes not exceed a given integer K. Here, \xe2\x8c\x8ax\xe2\x8c\x8b denotes the floor function - the largest integer which does not exceed x.\nWhen Chef joins the queue, his position in the queue is the number of the person directly behind him, or N+1 if he stands at the back of the queue. Find the minimum position at which Chef should join the queue, either by cutting in front of someone or (if it is impossible to cut in front of anyone without violating the condition above) standing at the back of the queue.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the minimum position at which Chef should join the queue.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4105 for each valid i\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (15 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nSubtask #2 (85 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 3\n1 2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85wild_hamster\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHONQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Difference Arrays, Pre processing, Prefix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Advanced Algorithms, Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2398\n\n\nDate Added:\n27-01-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
