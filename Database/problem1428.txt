b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nChef changed the password of his laptop a few days ago, but he can\'t remember it today. Luckily, he wrote the encrypted password on a piece of paper, along with the rules for decryption.\nThe encrypted password is a string S consists of ASCII printable characters except space (ASCII 33 - 126, in decimal notation, the same below). Read here for more details: ASCII printable characters.\nEach rule contains a pair of characters ci, pi, denoting that every character ci appears in the encrypted password should be replaced with pi. Notice that it is not allowed to do multiple replacements on a single position, see example case 1 for clarification.\nAfter all the character replacements, the string is guaranteed to be a positive decimal number. The shortest notation of this number is the real password. To get the shortest notation, we should delete all the unnecessary leading and trailing zeros. If the number contains only non-zero fractional part, the integral part should be omitted (the shortest notation of "0.5" is ".5"). If the number contains zero fractional part, the decimal point should be omitted as well (the shortest notation of "5.00" is "5").\nPlease help Chef to find the real password.\n \nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an interger T denoting the number of test cases.\nThe description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single interger N, denoting the number of rules.\nEach of the next N lines contains two space-separated characters ci and pi,\ndenoting a rule.\nThe next line contains a string S, denoting the encrypted password.\n \nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the real password.\n \nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 94\nAll characters in S and ci may be any ASCII printable character except space. (ASCII 33 - 126)\nAll ci in a single test case are distinct.\npi is a digit ("0" - "9") or a decimal point "." (ASCII 46).\nThe total length of S in a single input file will not exceed 106.\n \nExample\nInput:\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\n \n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n4\n2\n5 3\n3 1\n5\n0\n01800.00\n0\n0.00100\n3\nx 0\nd 3\n# .\n0xd21#dd098x\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1800\n.001\n321.33098\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85stzgd\n\n\nTester:\n2\xe2\x98\x85shiplu\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FORGETPW\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1686\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-05-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
