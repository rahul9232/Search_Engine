b'\nIn the gym, Chef prefers to lift at least WW grams during a bench press and if that\'s impossible, Chef considers his workout to be incomplete and feels bad.\nThe rod weighs WrWr grams and there are N other weights lying on the floor that weigh w1,w2,...,wN grams. To maintain balance and to ensure that there is no unnecessary load due to torque, it\'s important that the weights added to the left side are symmetric to the weights added to the right side. It is not required to use all of the weights. It is also not required to use any weights at all, if Chef feels satisfied lifting only the rod.\nFor example:\n\n1 2 2 1 |Rod Center| 1 1 1 3 is a wrong configuration, but\n1 2 3 1 |Rod Center| 1 3 2 1 is a right configuration.\n\nFind whether Chef will be able to collect the required weights to feel satisfied.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nEach test case contains two lines of input.\nThe first line contains three space-separated integers N,W,Wr.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers w1,w2,\xe2\x80\xa6,wN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the answer in a single line: "YES" if Chef will be satisfied after his workout and "NO" if not (without quotes).\nYou may print each character of each string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4W\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4wi\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Wr\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85104\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): wi=1 for all valid i \nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2 5 10 \n2 2\n7 100 50\n100 10 10 10 10 10 90 \n6 100 40 \n10 10 10 10 10 10\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: Since the weight of the rod is at least the required weight to be lifted, Chef will feel satisfied after the workout.\nTest case 2: The configuration having maximum weight is:\n10 10 |Rod Center| 10 10\nSo the maximum total weight Chef can lift is 50+4\xe2\x8b\x8510=90 which is less than the required amount to get satisfied.\nTest case 3: The configuration having maximum weight is:\n10 10 10 |Rod Center| 10 10 10\nSo the maximum total weight Chef can lift is 40+6\xe2\x8b\x8510=100 which is equal to the required amount to get satisfied.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BENCHP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Frequency Arrays, Greedy, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1611\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-04-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
