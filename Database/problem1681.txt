b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nChef is playing a game where he has an array A of N integers, and an integer K. He looks at every subarray of length K, and writes its sum on a piece of paper. If a number appears as the sum of multiple subarrays of length K, then he only writes down that number once.\nChef is lazy and doesn't like to write numbers. You, being a friend of Chef, want to modify the array such that Chef will only write one number on his paper. In one modification you can choose any index i and replace Ai with any integer.\nYou need to find the minimum number of modifications required.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains two lines of input.\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers N, K.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the answer in a single line.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4105\nThe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 3 \n1 2 3\n2 1\n4 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: K=3 and there is only one subarray of length 3, so no changes are required.\nTest Case 2: K=1 and the subarrays of length 1 are [4] and [6]. So, at least one modification is required. One possible solution with only one modification is to change A2 to 4.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85mohan18\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CSUBS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, Subarray\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms, Groupings\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2074\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-05-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
