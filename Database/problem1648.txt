b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a sequence A containing N integers A1, A2, ..., AN.\nChef is playing a game with this sequence. In this game, he may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): Choose an arbitrary pair of elements from the sequence such that their sum is even, delete these two elements from the sequence and insert their sum into the sequence instead.\nThe goal of the game is to minimise the number of elements in the sequence.\nHelp Chef to play the game and find the minimum possible size of the sequence at the end of the game!\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum possible final size of the sequence.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 1,000 for each valid i\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2\n1 2\n5\n7 4 3 2 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kefaa\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85mgch\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/L56GAME\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1051\n\n\nDate Added:\n16-01-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
