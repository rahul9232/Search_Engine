b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\n\nOh no! Chef\xe2\x80\x99s robot from problem "Reach The Point" (RETPO) has broken up. \nIt\'s old oil tank has got leaked, it is leaking oil now. \n\n\nThe robot start doing the following weird moves. While moving it keeps leaving a trace of oil on the path it\'s been tracing.\n\n\nNote that in a single step robot will move by one unit in the current direction it is moving.\n\nInitially the robot is at position (0, 0).\nIn the beginning it goes 1 step to the East (i.e. In a single step, its x coordinate will increase by 1 unit.)  \nthen 2 steps to the North, (i.e. In a single step, its y coordinate will increase by 1 unit.) \nthen 3 steps to the West, (i.e. In a single step, its x coordinate will decrease by 1 unit.)\nthen 4 steps to the South, (i.e. In a single step, its y coordinate will decrease by 1 unit.)\nthen 5 steps to the East, \n and so on.\n\n\nThus each time the robot turns 90 degrees anti clockwise, and it will go one more step than before. Please view the following image to \nunderstand the moves. The red line in the example shows the path traced by the robot having traces of oil on it.\n\n\n\n\nNow chef wants to know whether the point (X, Y) will have traces of oil on it or not. \n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n\n\nFor each test case, there is a single line containing two space-separated integers X and Y.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing \xe2\x80\x9cYES\xe2\x80\x9d (without quotes) if robot will reach point (X, Y) and \xe2\x80\x9cNO\xe2\x80\x9d otherwise.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100000 = 105\n-1000000000 \xe2\x89\xa4 X, Y \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000000, i.e., -109 \xe2\x89\xa4 X, Y \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3 3\n3 5\n0 0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\n\nThe points (0, 0) and (3, 3) will be having trace of oil while point (3, 5) will not have any trace of oil because point (3, 5) does not lie on the trajectory of robot.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nvitalij_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CRAWA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Case work, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1559\n\n\nDate Added:\n25-04-2014\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
