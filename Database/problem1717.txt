b"\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nChefland is a grid with NN rows and MM columns. Each cell of this grid is either empty or contains a house. The distance between a pair of houses is the Manhattan distance between the cells containing them.\nFor each dd between 1 and N+M\xe2\x88\x922 inclusive, Chef wants to calculate the number of unordered pairs of distinct houses with distance equal to d. Please help him!\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nN lines follow. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the i-th of these lines contains a binary string with length M; for each j (1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4M), the j-th character of this string is '1' if the cell in the i-th row and j-th column contains a house or '0' if it is empty.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing N+M\xe2\x88\x922 space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th integer should denote the number of pairs with distance i.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa43\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4300\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): N,M\xe2\x89\xa450\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\nExample Input\n1\n3 4\n0011\n0000\n0100\n\nExample Output\n1 0 1 1 0\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/AVGMAT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 easy-medium, implementation, kingofnumbers, prefix-sum, snck1a19, taran_1407\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-10-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n3 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
