More formally, a sequence S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SKS1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SK is good if it is possible to find two integers pp and qq such that S1\xe2\x8b\x85S2\xe2\x8b\x85\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x8b\x85SK=p2\xe2\x88\x92q2.\nChef has a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN. He wants to find the number of contiguous subsequences of A which are good. Can you help him?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of good contiguous subsequences of A.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n|Ai|\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): N\xe2\x89\xa4103\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n1 2 3\n3\n2 5 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: For the subsequences [1] and [3], their products can be represented as differences of two squared integers: 1=12\xe2\x88\x9202 and 3=22\xe2\x88\x9212 respectively.\nExample case 2: The two good subsequences are [5] and [2,5,6].
