b"\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nChef is participating in an ICPC regional contest, in which there is a total of NN problems (numbered 11 through N) with varying difficulties. For each valid i, the i-th easiest problem is problem Ai.\nAfter a team solves a problem, a balloon with a colour representing that problem is tied next to their desk. Chef is fond of colours in VIBGYOR, which are representative of the problems with numbers 1 through 7. The remaining problems have their own representative colours too.\nFind the minimum number of problems which Chef's team needs to solve in order to get all the balloons for problems 1 through 7 (and possibly some other balloons too) tied next to their desk, if you know that Chef's team knows the difficulties of all problems and solves the problems in increasing order of difficulty.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of problems Chef's team needs to solve.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,500\n7\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa415\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\nA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN are pairwise distinct\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 7 6\n8\n8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n9\n7 4 3 5 6 1 8 2 9\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n7\n8\n8\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: Since there are a total of 7 problems, Chef's team will have to solve all of them.\nExample case 2: Problems 1 through 7 appear among the first 8 problems.\nExample case 3: Problems 1 through 7 again appear among the first 8 problems.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BALLOON\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 1D Arrays, Brute Force, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1205\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-06-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
