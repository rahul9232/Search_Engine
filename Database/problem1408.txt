This time around, Snuffles has an array A containing N integers: A1, A2, ..., AN.\nBad news: Snuffles only loves to play with an array in which all the elements are equal.\nGood news: We have a mover of size D. ! \nA mover of size D is a tool which helps to change arrays. Chef can pick two existing elements Ai and Aj from the array, such that i + D = j and subtract 1 from one of these elements (the element should have its value at least 1), and add 1 to the other element. In effect, a single operation of the mover, moves a value of 1 from one of the elements to the other.\nChef wants to find the minimum number of times she needs to use the mover of size D to make all the elements of the array A equal. Help her find this out.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers N and D, denoting the number of elements in the array and the size of the mover. \nThe second line of each testcase contains N space-separated integers: A1, A2, ..., AN, denoting the initial elements of the array. \n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of uses or -1 if it is impossible to do what Snuffles wants.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 D < N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (30 points) : N \xe2\x89\xa4  103\nSubtask 2 (70 points) : Original constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n5 2\n1 4 5 2 3\n3 1\n1 4 1\n4 2\n3 4 3 5\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nTestcase 1:\nHere is a possible sequence of usages of the mover:\n\nMove 1 from A3 to A1\nMove 1 from A3 to A1\nMove 1 from A2 to A4\n\nAt the end, the array becomes (3, 3, 3, 3, 3), which Snuffles likes. And you cannot achieve this in fewer moves. Hence the answer is 3.\nTestcase 2:\nHere is a possible sequence of usages of the mover:\n\nMove 1 from A2 to A1\nMove 1 from A2 to A3\n\nAt the end, the array becomes (2, 2, 2), which Snuffles likes. And you cannot achieve this in fewer moves. Hence the answer is 2.\nTestcase 3:\nIt is impossible to make all the elements equal. Hence the answer is -1.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nberezin\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHEFMOVR\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1674\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-06-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
