b'\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nIt is the end of 2019 \xe2\x80\x94 the 17th of November, the Cooking Challenge day.\nThere are NN players participating in this competition, numbered 11 through NN. Initially, the skill level of each player is zero. There are also MM challenges (numbered 1 through M). For each valid i, the i-th challenge has three parameters Li, Ri and Xi with the following meaning: for each player between the Li-th and Ri-th inclusive, if this player participates in this challenge, their skill level increases by Xi (Xi does not have to be positive).\nThe organizers of the Cooking Challenge decided that the contest would be boring if they let the participants participate in the challenges directly, so they decided to use the compos.\nThere are Q compos (numbered 1 through Q). For each valid i, the i-th compo has two parameters Ai and Bi, which means that it includes the challenges Ai,Ai+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Bi.\nEach participant has to select a subset of the compos (possibly empty or the set of all Q compos) and participate in all challenges those compos include. A participant may not select the same compo twice, but may participate in the same challenge more than once if it is included in multiple chosen compos.\nFor each player, find the maximum skill level this player can reach if the compos are chosen optimally.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and Q.\nM lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers Li, Ri and Xi.\nQ more lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Ai and Bi.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should denote the maximum skill level of the i-th player.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa410,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x89\xa4Ri\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa4M for each valid i\n|Xi|\xe2\x89\xa41,000,000 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 1,000,000\nthe sum of M over all test cases does not exceed 5,000\nthe sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 50,000\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5 3 4\n1 1 3\n1 2 -4\n4 5 2\n1 2\n1 3\n1 1\n2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3 0 0 4 4\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nThe first player will select the 3-rd compo.\nThe second and third players will not select any compo.\nThe fourth player will select the 1-st, 2-nd and 4-th compos.\nThe fifth player will select all the compos.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n2\xe2\x98\x85mhammad1\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHADAY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Arrays, Dynamic Programming, Constructive\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2704\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-11-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
