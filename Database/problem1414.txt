The box contains NN chocolates in a row (numbered 11 through NN), where NN is even. For each valid ii, the ii-th chocolate has a sweetness value WiWi.\nChef wants to eat all the chocolates in the first half of the box and leave all chocolates in the second half uneaten. Since he does not like chocolates that are too sweet, he will be unhappy if at least one of the chocolates he eats has the maximum sweetness among all the chocolates in the box.\nA right cyclic shift by kk chocolates (0\xe2\x89\xa4k<N0\xe2\x89\xa4k<N) consists of moving the last kk chocolates in the row to the beginning in the same order and moving each of the remaining N\xe2\x88\x92kN\xe2\x88\x92k chocolates kk places to the right. Before eating the first half of the chocolates, Chef wants to perform some right cyclic shift in such a way that he will not be unhappy after eating them. Find the number of ways to do this, i.e. the number of valid integers kk such that if Chef performs the right cyclic shift by kk chocolates and then eats the first half of the chocolates in the box, he does not become unhappy.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers W1,W2,\xe2\x80\xa6,WNW1,W2,\xe2\x80\xa6,WN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of shifts for which Chef does not become unhappy.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa451\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nNN is even\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x89\xa4105 for each valid ii\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n6\n1 1 2 1 1 1\n6\n1 1 2 1 1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The three valid right shifts and the contents of the box for these shifts are:\n\nshift by k=1k=1: (1,1,1,2,1,1)(1,1,1,2,1,1)\nshift by k=2k=2: (1,1,1,1,2,1)(1,1,1,1,2,1)\nshift by k=3k=3: (1,1,1,1,1,2)(1,1,1,1,1,2)\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85imanik\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHCBOX\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, Cyclic Rotation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1730\n\n\nDate Added:\n13-03-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
