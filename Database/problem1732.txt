b"\nRead problems statements in Russian, Vietnamese, Hindi, Mandarin chinese and Bengali as well.\nChef has an inventory, which can be represented as a row of NN cells (numbered 11 through N). Each cell is either empty or contains a box. Chef wants to rearrange the boxes in such a way that they are all on the left side of the inventory (so if there are K boxes, they should occupy the leftmost K cells). He may perform two types of moves:\n\nchoose a cell i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x922); if cells i and i+2 are empty and cell i+1 contains a box, Chef stands in cell i+2 and pushes the box from cell i+1 to cell i\nchoose a cell i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x922); if cells i+1 and i+2 are empty and cell i contains a box, Chef stands in cell i+1 and pulls the box in cell i to cell i+1\n\nThe moves may be performed in any order, any number of times (possibly zero).\nFind the minimum number of moves required to get all boxes to the left side of the inventory or determine that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains a string with length N describing the inventory. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the i-th character of this string is '#' if the i-th cell contains a box or '.' if the i-th cell is empty.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of moves required, or \xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to move all boxes to the left.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nExample Input\n3\n6\n##.#..\n7\n.#.#.#.\n5\n##.##\n\nExample Output\n1\n6\n-1\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/INVENTRY\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, ad-hoc, Observation, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n3-11-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
