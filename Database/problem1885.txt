It has NN rows (numbered 11 through NN) and M columns (numbered 1 through M), where M\xe2\x89\xa52N. As training for her upcoming world chess championship match, she placed one bishop at row r and column c of her board. The remaining squares of the board are empty. Now, she is calculating the number of squares that can be reached by the bishop in at most K moves. Help Ada verify her answers.\nRemember that in one move, a bishop at row r and column c can move to another square at row r\xe2\x80\xb2 and column c\xe2\x80\xb2 if and only if either r+c=r\xe2\x80\xb2+c\xe2\x80\xb2 or r\xe2\x88\x92c=r\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x80\xb2.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers N, M, r, c and K.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of reachable squares.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa4109\n2N\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4M\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 7 1 1 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85alei\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ADASHOP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Case work, Basic Maths, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Special, Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3096\n\n\nDate Added:\n18-10-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
