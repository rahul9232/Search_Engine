b'\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef and his brother Chefu are playing a game with a sequence of N integers.\nThey take alternate turns to play. In each turn, the player should choose two adjacent integers from the sequence, remove them, and put in their place either their sum or their product. So if the sequence is (5,17,2,4,102), then one valid move would be to select 2 and 4, and replace them with their product, which is 8. So the sequence now becomes (5,17,8,102). They could also have been replaced by their sum, and in that case, the new sequence would become (5,17,6,102).\nThe game continues until there\'s only one integer left in the sequence. If this integer is even, then Chef is the winner, otherwise Chefu is the winner.\nGiven the initial sequence and the player who will play the first turn, you should tell who is going to win the game assuming that both of them play optimally.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nFirst line of each test-case contains N, the length of the initial sequence. and a string which is either "Chef" or "Chefu" denoting who will play first.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial sequence.\n \nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing who will win the game: "Chef" or "Chefu".\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10,000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100,000\nsum of N in all test-cases will not exceed 100,000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4  Ai  \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1 Chef\n8\n3 Chef\n1 2 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nChef\nChefu\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: The game stops as soon as it begins, because there is only one integer, and because it is even, Chef wins.\nTest case 2: Chef has 4 valid first moves:\n\nAdd 1 and 2, and change the sequence to (3,3). Now Chefu will multiply these two, and get 9, and win, because only one integer is left, and it is odd.\nMultiply 1 and 2, and change the sequence to (2,3). Now Chefu will add these two, and get 5, and win, because only one integer is left, and it is odd.\nAdd 2 and 3, and change the sequence to (1,5). Now Chefu will multiply these two, and get 5, and win, because only one integer is left, and it is odd.\nMultiply 2 and 3, and change the sequence to (1,6). Now Chefu will add these two, and get 7, and win, because only one integer is left, and it is odd.\n\n\n\nAs we can see, for every possible move of Chef, Chefu has a move that lets him win. Hence, in optimal play, Chefu will win.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nTester:\n7\xe2\x98\x85errichto\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ADDMULT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Game Theory, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2763\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-10-2016\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
