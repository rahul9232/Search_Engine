It is guaranteed that N is even.\nFor a positive integer k, let's define a graph Hk as follows:\n\nHk has N vertices numbered 1 through N.\nFor each edge (u,v) in G, there is an edge (u,v) in Hk too.\nFor each pair of vertices (u,v) in G such that their distance is at most k, there is an edge (u,v) in Hk.\n\nWe call a graph good if its vertices can be split into two sets U and V satisfying the following:\n\nEach vertex appears in exactly one set; |U|=|V|=N/2.\nLet E be the set of edges (u,v) such that u\xe2\x88\x88U and v\xe2\x88\x88V. It is possible to reach any vertex from any other vertex using only the edges in E.\n\nYour task is to find the minimum value of k such that Hk is a good graph, and one possible way to partition vertices of this graph Hk into the sets U and V defined above. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting an edge between vertices u and v in G.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print three lines.\nThe first line should contain a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum value of k.\nThe second line should contain N/2 space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x94 the numbers of vertices in your set U.\nThe third line should also contain N/2 space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x94 the numbers of vertices in your set V.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410,000\nN is even\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe graph on the input is a tree\n\nSubtasks\n\n25 points: 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200\n75 points: no extra constraints\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2\n1 2\n6\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n3 5\n3 6\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n2\n2\n1 3 5\n2 4 6\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin2\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GRAPART\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Trees, ad-hoc, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Graphs, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2041\n\n\nDate Added:\n7-12-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
