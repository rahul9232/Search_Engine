b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nA permutation is an array consisting of NN distinct integers from 11 to NN in arbitrary order.\nChef has two permutation arrays A and P of length N. Chef performs the following three types of operations on the array A:\n\n1 : Permute the array A according to the order defined by permutation P.That is, replace A with the array B where B[P[i]]=A[i].\n2\xc2\xa0x\xc2\xa0y : Swap the elements at positions x and y in A.\n3\xc2\xa0x : Output the element at position x in array A. \n\nFor each operation of type 3, Chef wants you to output the element at position x in array A after all preceding operations have been applied.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N integers denoting elements of array A.\nThe third line contains N integers denoting elements of array P.\nThe fourth line contains a single integer Q, denoting the number of operations to be performed.\nQ lines follow, each describing an operation of one of the three types above.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, for each query of type 3, output the answer in a separate line.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A[i],P[i],x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N\nA and P are permutations.\nx\xe2\x89\xa0y in type 2 operations.\nThe sum of N and the sum of Q over all test cases do not exceed 105.\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n    3\n    1 2 3\n    2 3 1\n    3\n    1\n    2 2 3\n    3 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nExplanation\nInitially, array A is [1,2,3].\nIt changes as follows: [1,2,3] -> [3,1,2] -> [3,2,1].\nSo, we output element at position 1 in array A, which is 3.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85ashish99hanny\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/P7SWAPS\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Cycles, Binary lifting, Groupings\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms, Graph Algos, Lowest Common Ancestor\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2592\n\n\nDate Added:\n3-05-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
