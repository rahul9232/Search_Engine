b"\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has two matrices A and B, each with size N\xc3\x97M. Each cell of the matrix A contains a character '0' or '1', while each cell of the matrix B contains '?', '0' or '1'.\nThe matrix A can be modified using zero or more operations. In one operation, Chef can choose two cells in the matrix A which lie either in the same row or in the same column and flip the characters in each of these cells (flipping means changing '1' to '0' or '0' to '1').\nChef wants the matrix A to match the matrix B. Formally, for each row r and column c, if the cell in row r and column c of B contains '0' or '1', then he wants the cell in row r and column c of A to contain the same character; otherwise (for cells containing '?'), it may contain either '0' or '1'.\nThe difficulty of your task is described by a parameter E. If E=0, you should only find the smallest number of operations required to achieve this goal. If E=1, you should also find one sequence of operations with the smallest length which achieves it.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and E.\nN lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains a single string Ai with length M describing the i-th row of the matrix A.\nN more lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains a single string Bi with length M describing the i-th row of the matrix B.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf it is not possible to make A match B, print a single line containing the integer \xe2\x88\x921.\nOtherwise, first, print a line containing a single integer K \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest required number of operations.\nThen, if E=1, print K lines describing the sequence of operations you want to perform. An operation should be printed in one of the following formats:\nR r i j to flip the characters in cells in row r and columns i and j (1\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N, 1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4M)\nC c i j to flip the characters in cells in column c and rows i and j (1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4M, 1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4N)\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may find any one of them.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n0\xe2\x89\xa4E\xe2\x89\xa41\nfor each valid i, Ai contains only characters '0' and '1'\nfor each valid i, Bi contains only characters '?', '0' and '1'\nthe sum of N\xe2\x8b\x85M over all test cases does not exceed 200,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\nT\xe2\x89\xa43\nN\xe2\x8b\x85M\xe2\x89\xa416\n\nSubtask #2 (10 points):\n\ninitially, for each pair of side-adjacent cells in the matrix A, the characters in them are different (A follows a chessboard pattern)\nfor each valid i, each character of Bi is '0'\n\nSubtask #3 (30 points):\n\nE=0\nfor each valid i, Bi contains only characters '0' and '1'\n\nSubtask #4 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3 3 1\n010\n101\n101\n100\n110\n?00\n2 2 0\n10\n01\n0?\n??\n1 3 1\n101\n010\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\nC 2 1 2\nC 3 2 3\nC 1 3 1\n1\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: This is not the only solution ? a valid sequence of 3 row operations also exists.\nExample case 2: We did not restore the sequence of operations because E=0.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85bthero\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PAIRFLIP\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy, DFS, Bipartite\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Graph Algos, Traversals, Coloring\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3099\n\n\nDate Added:\n19-03-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
