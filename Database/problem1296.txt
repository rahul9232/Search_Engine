He bought N baskets of candies (numbered 1 through N); for each valid i, the i-th basket contains ai candies.\nEach friend should get at most one candy. For each valid i, the i-th friend would like to get a candy either from one of the first Li baskets or one of the last Ri baskets, i.e. a from basket b (1\xe2\x89\xa4b\xe2\x89\xa4N) such that b\xe2\x89\xa4Li or b\xe2\x89\xa5N+1\xe2\x88\x92Ri.\nHasan loves his friends, so he wants as many of them as possible to get the candies they want. If he distributes the candies optimally, what is the maximum number of his friends who will get the candies they want?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN.\nM lines follow. For each i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4M), the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Li and Ri.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of Hasan's friends who can get the candies they want.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4106\n0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid i\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Li,Ri\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Li+Ri\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\nthe sum of M over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 3\n1 1 1\n0 2\n1 1\n0 2\n3 3\n1 1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We can give a candy from basket 1 to the 2-nd friend, a candy from basket 2 to the 1-st friend and a candy from basket 3 to the 3-rd friend.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n5\xe2\x98\x85i_love_islam\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/FRICAN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Flow Networks, Greedy, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Advanced Algorithms, Advanced Graph Algos, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n3097\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-08-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n2 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
