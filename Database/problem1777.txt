There is a direct way to travel between each pair of cities. Each city has a specific temperature; let\'s denote the temperature in the i-th city by Ci. Chef has a fixed temperature tolerance D with the following meaning: for each pair of cities a and b, he may travel from city a directly to city b only if |Ca\xe2\x88\x92Cb|\xe2\x89\xa4D, otherwise he would catch a heavy flu because of the sudden change in temperature.\nChef starts from city 1. Is he able to visit all N cities in such a way that each city is visited exactly once?\nNotes:\n\nChef is not able to travel through a city without visiting it.\nCity 1 is visited at the beginning.\nIt is not necessary to be able to travel directly to city 1 from the last city Chef visits.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and D.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers C1,C2,\xe2\x80\xa6,CN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" (without quotes) if Chef can visit all cities or "NO" (without quotes) if he cannot.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 10,000\n\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n5 3\n3 2 1 4 5\n5 4\n10 1 3 2 9\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TRVLCHEF\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 ad-hoc, Sorting, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2409\n\n\nDate Added:\n29-03-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
