Let's denote the height of the i-th hill from the left by hi.\nAda is working on the water supply system of ChefLand. On some of the hills, she wants to place water reservoirs; then, for each reservoir, she will decide in which direction the water should flow from it \xe2\x80\x94 either to the left or to the right (water may not flow in both directions from the same reservoir). From a reservoir on a hill with height h, water flows in the chosen direction until it reaches the first hill that is strictly higher than h; all hills before this hill (including the hill containing the reservoir) are therefore supplied with water.\nFor example, suppose we have hills with heights [7,2,3,5,8]. If we place a reservoir on the hill with height 5, and pump water from it to the left, then the hills with heights 2, 3 and 5 are supplied with water.\nHelp Ada find the minimum numer of reservoirs needed to provide water to all the hills if she chooses the directions optimally.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers h1,h2,\xe2\x80\xa6,hN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum required number of reservoirs.\nConstraints\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\nhi\xe2\x89\xa0hj for any valid i\xe2\x89\xa0j\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6\n4 16 32 6 8 2\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We can place reservoirs on the second and third hill, pumping water to the left and right respectively.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85alei\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/PUMPWAT\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Stacks, 1D Arrays, Segment Trees, Observation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Advanced Data Structures, Advanced Tree Structures, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2068\n\n\nDate Added:\n17-10-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
