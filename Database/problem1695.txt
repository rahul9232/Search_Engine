The design is a planar figure that can be drawn in the following way:\n\nDraw a point A0A0 and two rays from this point such that the angle between them is \xce\xb1<\xcf\x80/2.\nMark N points A1,A2,A3,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN on one ray in this order (A1 is closest to A0).\nMark N points B1,B2,B3,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN on the other ray in this order (B1 is closest to A0).\nFor each valid i, draw a line segment between points Ai and Bi+1.\nFor each valid i, draw a line segment between points Bi and Ai+1.\nFinally, draw a line segment between points AN and BN.\nAll these 2N\xe2\x88\x921 line segments must have equal lengths, which must also be equal to |A0A1|=|A0B1|.\n\nThe result should look roughly like this:\n\nChefY wants to show ChefX that he does not know his own design very well. He asks ChefX to compute the angle between three of the marked points in this figure. It is clear that there are only four types of angles:\n\n\xe2\x88\xa0AxAyBz\n\xe2\x88\xa0AxByAz\n\xe2\x88\xa0AxByBz\n\xe2\x88\xa0BxAyBz\n\nCan you help ChefX find the angle ChefY asks for? It can be proved that under the given constraints, each angle can be written as \xcf\x80\xe2\x8b\x85m/n, where m and n are coprime integers; you should find m and n.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers N, t, x, y and z. Here, t denotes the type of the angle as listed above.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing two space-separated integers m and n.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa44\neach angle is between three of the points A0,A1,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN,B1,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN\n|x\xe2\x88\x92y|=1\n|y\xe2\x88\x92z|=1\neach angle is non-zero\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\nSubtask #2 (90 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n175456798 1 151163203 151163204 151163205\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n66583464 116971199\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The type is 1, so the angle we want is A151163203A151163204B151163205.
