First, he went to purchase fruits from Pintu.\nPintu sells MM different types of fruits (numbered 11 through MM). He sells them in NN baskets (numbered 11 through NN), where for each valid ii, the ii-th basket costs PiPi and it contains fruits of type FiFi. Chef does not have too much money, so he cannot afford to buy everything; instead, he wants to choose one of the MM available types and purchase all the baskets containing fruits of that type.\nHelp Chef choose the type of fruit to buy such that he buys at least one basket and the total cost of the baskets he buys is the smallest possible.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.\nThe second line contains NN space-separated integers F1,F2,\xe2\x80\xa6,FNF1,F2,\xe2\x80\xa6,FN.\nThe third line contains NN space-separated integers P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum price Chef must pay.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M,N\xe2\x89\xa4501\xe2\x89\xa4M,N\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Fi\xe2\x89\xa4M1\xe2\x89\xa4Fi\xe2\x89\xa4M for each valid ii\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4500\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa450 for each valid ii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): M=2M=2\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6 4\n1 2 3 3 2 2\n7 3 9 1 1 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nThe sum of all baskets with fruits of type 11 is 77.\nThe sum of all baskets with fruits of type 22 is 55.\nThe sum of all baskets with fruits of type 33 is 1010.\nThe sum of all baskets with fruits of type 44 is 00 because there are no such baskets.\n\nChef can only choose fruits of type 11, 22 or 33. Therefore, the minimum price he has to pay is 55.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85euler_euler\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CHPINTU\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 1D Arrays, Brute Force, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Data Structures, Arrays, Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1313\n\n\nDate Added:\n28-01-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
