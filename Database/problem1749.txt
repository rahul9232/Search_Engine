He wants to use them to record his clients' signatures.\nThe board is a grid with NN rows (numbered 11 through NN) and M columns (numbered 1 through M) of pixels. Initially, all pixels are white. A client uses the electronic pen to sign on the board; whenever the pen touches a pixel, this pixel becomes black. Note that a signature may be non-continuous (a client may lift the pen while signing).\nChef stores a typical signature of his current client as a matrix of characters Ai,j, where for each valid i and j, Ai,j is either '1' (if the cell in the i-th row and j-th column is black) or '0' (if this cell is white). The client just signed on the board; this signature is stored in the same form as a matrix Bi,j. Chef wants to know how close this signature is to this client's typical signature.\nTwo signatures are considered the same if it is possible to choose (possibly negative) integers dr and dc such that for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N and 1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4M, Ai,j=Bi+dr,j+dc. Here, if Bi+dr,j+dc does not correspond to a valid cell, it is considered to be '0'.\nTo compare the signatures, the colours of zero or more cells must be flipped in such a way that the signatures become the same (each flipped cell may be in any matrix). The error in the client's current signature is the minimum number of cells whose colours must be flipped. Find the error in the signature.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nN lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains a string with length M describing the i-th row of the matrix A.\nN more lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains a string with length M describing the i-th row of the matrix B.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the error in the current signature.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa425\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n3 3\n100\n010\n000\n000\n010\n001\n4 4\n0000\n0110\n0000\n0011\n1100\n0000\n1100\n0000\n3 3\n100\n000\n001\n000\n010\n000\n3 3\n000\n010\n000\n100\n000\n001\n3 3\n111\n000\n000\n001\n001\n001\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85kingofnumbers\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/SIGNTURE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Brute Force\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2138\n\n\nDate Added:\n14-11-2019\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
