There are a total of NN gold mines, numbered 11 through N. For each valid i, the i-th gold mine contains Gi gold in total; if only Chef worked in it, it would take him Ai days to completely mine it, while if only Chefu worked in it, it would take him Bi days.\nEach of our miners may only work in one mine at a time, but they may decide to start working in another mine at any time (even in the middle of some day), any number of times. They also choose the mines to work in independently from each other and they may work in the same mine at the same time. Mining gold is a continuous process, i.e. if a miner works for t days (where t is a real number) in a mine where this miner has mining speed g gold per day, then he will mine g\xe2\x8b\x85t gold. Obviously, it is impossible to work in a mine after no gold remains in it. For example, if a gold mine contains 30 gold and Chef needs 2 days to completely mine it, but he spends 1 day in it, then he will mine 15 gold; if Chefu needs 1 day to completely mine the same gold mine, and both Chef and Chefu start working in this mine at the same time, it will be empty after 2/3 days \xe2\x80\x95 Chefu will mine 20 gold, while Chef will mine 10 gold.\nAt each point of time, both Chef and Chefu know the gold mine in which the other miner is working. Each of them wants to gather the maximum amount of gold for himself. Find the amounts of gold the miners will have if they both act optimally.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nN lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers Gi, Ai and Bi.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated real numbers \xe2\x80\x95 the amount of gold mined by Chef and the amount of gold mined by Chefu. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error of each amount of gold does not exceed 10\xe2\x88\x926.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Gi\xe2\x89\xa4105 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4105 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa4105 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): N\xe2\x89\xa42\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n30 2 1\n3\n10 1 1\n20 2 2\n30 3 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n10.00000 20.00000\n30.00000 30.00000\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nadmin3\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/GOLMINE\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Basic Maths, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2033\n\n\nDate Added:\n26-06-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
