Now, people are lining up in a queue at the local shop and it is your duty to check whether they are all following this advice.\nThere are a total of NN spots (numbered 11 through N) where people can stand in front of the local shop. The distance between each pair of adjacent spots is 1 foot. Each spot may be either empty or occupied; you are given a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN, where for each valid i, Ai=0 means that the i-th spot is empty, while Ai=1 means that there is a person standing at this spot. It is guaranteed that the queue is not completely empty.\nFor example, if N=11 and the sequence A is (0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1), then this is a queue in which people are not following the advice because there are two people at a distance of just 3 feet from each other.\nYou need to determine whether the people outside the local shop are following the social distancing advice or not. As long as some two people are standing at a distance smaller than 6 feet from each other, it is bad and you should report it, since social distancing is not being followed.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe next line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if social distancing is being followed or "NO" otherwise (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41 for each valid i\nat least one spot is occupied\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n1 0 1\n7\n1 0 0 0 0 0 1\n11\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The first and third spots are occupied and the distance between them is 2 feet.\nExample case 2: The first and seventh spots are occupied and the distance between them is 6 feet.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ntaran_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/COVIDLQ\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Modular Arithmetic, Basic Maths, ad-hoc\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Constructive\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\nN/A\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-04-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
