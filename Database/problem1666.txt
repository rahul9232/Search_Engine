The rectangles must be axis-aligned, meaning the sides are vertical and horizontal.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nEach test case contains N+1 lines of input.\nThe first line contains a single integer N, the number of points. \nThe next N lines each contains two integers xi, yi, the coordinates of the i-th point.\n\nNote: Points need not be distinct.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4109\nThe sum of N over all test cases is at most 105.\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n1\n100 100\n4\n1 100\n100 100\n100 1\n1 1\n5\n1 100\n100 100\n100 1\n1 1\n50 50\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n4851\n\n\nExplanation\nCase 1: Since there is only one point, the minimum area of a rectangle to cover this point is 0.\nCase 2: We can have rectangles as 2 opposite sides of the square. Since the width of the rectangles is 0, the total area is also 0.\n\nCase 3: The optimal solution is with the rectangles having endpoints {(1,1),(100,1),(1,50),(100,50)} and {(1,100),(1,100),(100,100),(100,100)}. Therefore the total area is 49\xe2\x8b\x8599+0\xe2\x8b\x8599=4851\n\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nTester:\n6\xe2\x98\x85iscsi\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/DAREA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Geometry, Constructive, Prefix Sum, Suffix Sum\n                 \n                     \n                     Mathematics, Algorithms, Simple Algos\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n2032\n\n\nDate Added:\n9-02-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
