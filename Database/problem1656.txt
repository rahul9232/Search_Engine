Bob is not dressed properly and he does not wish to take any chances, so he wants to rush to an apartment of one of his NN friends, change there and meet Alice for the dinner.\nAlice and Bob's friends live in a skyscraper with many floors. Alice lives on the aa-th floor, the apartments of Bob's friends are located on the floors F1,F2,\xe2\x80\xa6,FNF1,F2,\xe2\x80\xa6,FN and Bob is initially at the b-th floor. It takes exactly 1 minute to go one floor up or down from each floor.\nBob needs exactly c minutes to change in any of his friends' apartments. Find the minimum time he needs to go to one of his friends' apartments, change and get to Alice's apartment.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers N, a, b and c.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers F1,F2,\xe2\x80\xa6,FN.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum time Bob needs.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,c\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Fi\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3 1 5 2\n6 7 8\n1 1 2 1000000000\n1000000000\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n8\n2999999997\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: In the optimal solution, Bob goes to his friend at floor 6, changes there and goes to meet Alice. The total time is (6\xe2\x88\x925) to reach his friend plus 2 to change plus (6\xe2\x88\x921) to reach Alice, which is 1+2+5=8 minutes.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n4\xe2\x98\x85noobie27\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/BFRIEND\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Brute Force\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1332\n\n\nDate Added:\n21-01-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
