b'\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese\n, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nVanja and Miksi have already finished everything for this year at their university, so they decided to spend their free time playing a game with a binary sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN (i.e. a sequence containing only integers 00 and 11).\nAt the beginning of the game, Vanja and Miksi write down the expression \xe2\x88\x97A1\xe2\x88\x97A2\xe2\x88\x97A3\xe2\x88\x97\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x88\x97AN (note below that each \xe2\x88\x97 is a placeholder and does not denote multiplication).\nThe players take turns alternately, starting with Vanja. The game lasts N turns. In each turn, the current player must replace the first (leftmost) remaining \xe2\x88\x97 by the sign + or \xe2\x88\x92 (or, equivalently, by the operation of addition or subtraction).\nAfter the last turn, the boys calculate the resulting value V of the expression. If |V|\xe2\x89\xa5K, the winner is Vanja; otherwise, the winner is Miksi.\nPlease predict the winner of the game if both players play optimally. \nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 1 if Vanja (the first player) is the winner or 2 if Miksi (the second player) is the winner.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85104\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85104\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41 for each valid i\n\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n2 1\n1 0\n3 5\n0 1 0\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: K=1, so if Vanja replaces the first \xe2\x88\x97 by +, the value of the final expression will be V=1; then, K\xe2\x89\xa4|V|, so the winner is Vanja.\nExample case 2: K=5, but the absolute value of the final expression cannot be greater than 1. The winner is Miksi.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n6\xe2\x98\x85allllekssssa\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MIXGA\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Observation, Implementation\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1637\n\n\nDate Added:\n12-08-2018\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nPYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
