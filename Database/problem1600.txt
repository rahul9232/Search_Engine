b'\nWhen Chef was born, his parents took him to the famous monk Doctor Strange to know whether he will land himself in heaven after his life or not. According to Strange, Chef will live for LL years in total. If he wants to go to heaven, he must spend at least 50%50% of his life years doing good deeds. He also shows them his future using a string SS of length L where Si=0 means the i-th year will be counted as bad as per the rule books of heaven and Si=1 means the i-th year will be counted as good.\nAlso, Strange can use his special powers to make Chef end his life earlier than that planned by god, i.e, he can choose some L\xe2\x80\xb2 (1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x89\xa4L) and make him live for only L\xe2\x80\xb2 years. Strange wants Chef to succeed, so if there is any choice of L\xe2\x80\xb2 that allows Chef to go to heaven, he will do so.\nTell whether Chef can go to heaven.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \nEach test case contains two lines of input.\nThe first line contains a single integer L.\nThe second line contains a string S of length L, consisting of symbols 0 and 1.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the answer in a single line: "YES" if Chef can go to heaven and "NO" if not (without quotes).\nYou may print each character of each string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4105\nThe sum of L over all tests does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n2\n10\n3\n001\n4\n0100\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: If Chef lives for the complete 2 years, he will have a total of 1 good year which is 1\xe2\x88\x971002=50% of his life, and hence he will go to heaven.\nTest case 2: There\'s no way Chef can go to heaven.\nTest case 3: If Chef lives for 2 years, he will have a total of 1 good year which is 1\xe2\x88\x971002=50% of his life, and hence he will go to heaven.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\ndaanish_adm\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/CCHEAVEN\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Greedy\n                 \n                     \n                     Algorithms\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1317\n\n\nDate Added:\n2-04-2021\n\n\nTime Limit:\n0.5 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n'
