b"\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nAlice and Bob are walking on an infinite straight street. Initially, both are at the position X=0X=0 and they start walking in the direction of increasing XX. After NN seconds, they stop. Let's denote Alice's speed and Bob's speed during the i-th of these seconds by Ai and Bi respectively.\nSometimes, Alice and Bob walk together, i.e. with the same speed side by side. Let's define the weird distance as the total distance they walk this way. Find this weird distance.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN.\nThe third line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the total weird distance. It can be proved that this distance is an integer.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4105 for each valid i\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa4105 for each valid i\nthe sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n                        Sample Input 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n4\n1 3 3 4\n1 2 4 4\n2\n2 3\n3 2\n2\n3 3\n3 3\n\n\n\n                        Sample Output 1\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n0\n6\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nAlice and Bob walk side by side during the first second, from X=0 to X=1.\nThen, Alice starts walking faster than Bob, so they do not walk side by side during second 2. At the end of second 2, Alice is at X=4, while Bob is at X=3.\nDuring the next second, they again do not walk side by side, but Bob walks faster, so they both end up at X=7.\nDuring the last second, they both walk side by side and the distance they walk is 4.\nAlice and Bob walk side by side during the 1-st and 4-th second and the total weird distance they travel is 1+4=5.\n\nExample case 2:\n\nFirst, Alice walks with speed 2 and Bob walks with speed 3, so they do not walk side by side. Alice ends up at X=2, while Bob ends up at X=3 at the end of the 1-st second.\nThen, Alice walks with speed 3 and Bob walks with speed 2, so they do not walk side by side either.\nAlthough Alice and Bob both end up at X=5 at the end of the 2-nd second, the weird distance is 0.\n\nExample case 3: We can see that Alice and Bob always walk together, so the weird distance is 3+3=6.\n\n\n\nAuthor:\n7\xe2\x98\x85vivek_1998299\n\n\nEditorial:\nhttps://discuss.codechef.com/problems/WWALK\n\n\nTags:\n\n               \n                 Physics\n                 \n                     \n                     Special\n                 \n               \n             \n             \n\n\n\n                        Difficulty Rating:\n                    \n\n1274\n\n\nDate Added:\n20-05-2020\n\n\nTime Limit:\n1 secs\n\n\nSource Limit:\n50000 Bytes\n\n\nLanguages:\nCPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEM\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n"
